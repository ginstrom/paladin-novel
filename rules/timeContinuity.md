## Major Time Discrepancies Identified

### 1. **Chapter 8 vs Chapter 9 Timing Conflict**
- **Issue**: Chapter 8 mentions "prepare for winter" but Chapter 9 is set in "mid to late summer"
- **Problem**: This suggests Chapter 8 occurs in late summer/early fall, but Chapter 9 explicitly states it's summer with planting season past
- **Suggested Fix**: Revise Chapter 8 to remove "winter" references, replace with "prepare for the coming seasons" or "prepare for harder times"

### 2. **Settlement Development Timeline**
- **Issue**: References to "months" of development may be compressed
- **Problem**: From mid-April (escape) to mid-summer (Chapter 9) is only 3-4 months, but settlement shows extensive development
- **Suggested Fix**: Either extend timeline or adjust development descriptions to be more realistic for timeframe

### 3. **Chapter 16 Six-Month Reference**
- **Issue**: Maera mentions "For the past six months" of travel
- **Problem**: If Chapter 16 is in late fall of Year 1, six months back would be late spring, but Gond's story began in mid-April
- **Suggested Fix**: Adjust to "For the past few months" or clarify the reference point

### 4. **Chapter 22 Settlement Age Reference**
- **Issue**: "Six months ago, this settlement didn't exist"
- **Problem**: If Chapter 22 is early summer Year 2, six months back would be winter Year 1, but settlement was established in spring/early summer Year 1
- **Suggested Fix**: Change to "A year ago" or "Over a year ago"

## Seasonal Progression Summary

**Year 1:**
- **Spring (Mid-April to June)**: Escape, journey, settlement establishment (Chapters 1-8)
- **Summer (July-August)**: Food crisis, first raids, divine awakening (Chapters 9-11)
- **Fall (September-November)**: Power development, alliances (Chapters 12-16)
- **Winter (December-February)**: First major conflicts (Chapters 17-18)

**Year 2:**
- **Spring (March-May)**: Political organization, preparation (Chapters 19-21)
- **Summer (June-August)**: Major military campaign (Chapters 22-25)
- **Fall (September-November)**: Victory, government formation (Chapter 26)

## Recommended Timeline Adjustments

1. **General**: Add more specific seasonal markers throughout to maintain consistency
2. **Weather descriptions**: Ensure weather references match the established seasonal timeline

## Notes for Future Reference

- The story spans approximately 18 months from escape to victory
- Major seasonal transitions should be marked more clearly
- Character development and settlement growth should align with realistic timeframes
- Military campaigns follow logical seasonal patterns (summer fighting season)
- Divine power development follows a realistic progression over the extended timeline
