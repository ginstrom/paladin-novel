PART I  
*The Rude Awakening*  
 

# **Chapter 1: The Mark of Betrayal**

Gond woke up with the second-worst hangover of his life and a splitting headache to boot. His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth like old leather. Blood, stale ale, and something bitter that made his throat constrict. His forehead throbbed with each heartbeat. The pain was sharp enough to make his eyes water before he’d even opened them.

When he finally cracked one eyelid, pale moonlight leaked through gaps in warped planking above. The surface beneath him rose and fell in a gentle rhythm that sent his stomach lurching sideways.

*Ship.* The realization jolted him from his stupor.

Iron clinked against his wrist as he tried to sit up. Manacles. He succeeded in his second attempt to rise, punctuated with a soldier’s curse. He had to lean heavily against splintered timber that felt damp under his palm.

An itch flared across his forehead. His fingers rose instinctively. They found raised, tender flesh—still raw, still seeping. Heat radiated from the wound. The skin felt thick and ridged under his touch. Gond’s breath caught.

A bucket of murky water sat within reach, its surface barely catching the moonlight. Gond stared at it for a long moment, his throat working silently. When he finally leaned forward, his movements were deliberate, almost mechanical. Gradually a face came into focus on the dim surface of the water. Lantern jaw, unshaven. Hawkish nose, badly broken once. Ice-blue eyes under jutting brows. And above them, a brand.

Two interlocked manacles, each no larger than a copper coin, burned into his flesh with deliberate precision. The slaver’s mark.

A muscle jumped in his jaw. His chest rose and fell—too shallow, too measured, nostrils flaring with each careful intake. Gond wrenched his gaze from the bucket and took a deliberate look around him.

The hold stretched before him in the dim light. A collection of hunched shapes chained in pairs. The air hung thick with the smell of unwashed bodies, fear-sweat, and something else. Something that made him breathe through his mouth.

The man beside him had shoulders like a dock worker and fists to match. Purple bruises mottled his face. His thick wrists were chafed where he’d fought his bonds. Air wheezed through his throat, each intake scraping like sandpaper. His eyes flicked open, pupils sharp as broken glass, glancing at Gond before resuming his brooding. The muscles in his jaw kept working, like he was chewing on words too dangerous to speak.

Across from Gond, two figures slumped forward. One sat perfectly still—too still. His head lolled at an angle that spoke of either a broken neck or final surrender. Flies had begun their grisly work around his vacant stare. Tattered silk clung to his frame—once fine clothing now stained with blood and worse.

His companion coughed wetly, each breath a visible struggle. Waxy skin stretched over sharp cheekbones. His chest barely moved with each shallow intake. Ink stains marked his fingertips. A scribe or clerk by the look of him.

*Not much time left for that one.*  
Two more bodies lay motionless further into the hold. A woman with farmer’s hands and sun-weathered skin. What might have been a young man, though the shadows made it hard to tell. Behind him, someone breathed like an angry bull, all snorts and barely contained fury. The occasional clink of metal suggested a soldier or guard, still wearing pieces of armor they hadn’t bothered to strip.

Gond flexed his fingers, testing the chain’s give. Solid. Professional work. His captors knew their business.

Memory crept back in fragments. Borin’s flushed face raised in a toast at the Prancing Dragon, his voice booming over the tavern’s din: “To Gond, luckiest sword on the coast\!” A swimming head too drunk after just two pints of ale. Kael’s answering smirk as the room turned sideways and his vision dimmed. Those cold eyes catching torchlight as he leaned close, and the last words he recalled before waking up on the ship: “Business, mate. Nothing personal.”

Then darkness.

*Luckiest sword on the coast.* The bitter irony wasn’t lost on him. He’d built that reputation by being selective about his contracts. Never worked for slavers—not out of any grand moral stance, just distaste for the business.

The Slaver’s Guild paid well enough, but their work left a sour taste that no amount of coin could wash away. He’d seen their ships before, heard the stories from other mercenaries who took their silver. Always told himself it wasn’t his fight.

The Guild was too powerful, too connected. Kings and nobles lined their pockets with slaver gold. Temples blessed their ventures. Who was one sword to stand against an empire built on human misery? Better to take honest work—caravan guards, debt collection, the occasional border skirmish. Clean jobs with clean coin.

*Look how well that worked out.*  
Behind him, chained to the opposite bulkhead, sat a wiry man who had the same air of a mercenary that Gond did when he looked in a mirror. Beside the mercenary, close enough that their chains clinked together when either moved, was a slim, unassuming man whose aura of calm seemed out of place. The mercenary leaned forward, catching Gond’s eye across the narrow space between them. “How long was I out?” Gond murmured.

“A couple of days. Weren’t sure you were going to make it there, mate.” The wiry man gestured with his manacled hands. “Name’s Pell by the way. And my companion here is Sim.” Sim sketched a nod with a wry smile, his chains rattling softly.

Pell jerked his head toward the dock worker beside Gond. “And that lunk chained up to you is Jord.” Jord gave a grunt and turned away.

Gond’s fingers wandered again to the brand.

“Yeah, you’ve got one just like the rest of us,” murmured Pell sympathetically.

For the first time, Gond looked around and saw the same manacle tattoo on every forehead in the hold.

Gond’s free hand clenched against his thigh. The chain between his wrists clinked softly as a tremor ran through his shoulders—brief, quickly suppressed, but there nonetheless.

The ship creaked around him in steady rhythm. Above, boots scuffed across deck planks, punctuated by coarse laughter and the occasional crack of a whip. When food came—moldy bread and brackish water in filthy buckets—guards tossed it down like they were feeding animals. The dock worker beside Gond lunged for his portion with desperate efficiency. He tore into the moldy crust like a man who’d known hunger before. The dying scribe could only manage a few sips of water before his head lolled back, exhausted by the effort.

In the far corner, a woman’s voice whispered what sounded like a lullaby—broken, barely audible, but persistent. Someone else muttered prayers in a dialect Gond didn’t recognize. The words were punctuated by the soft clink of what might have been prayer beads. The soldier behind him said nothing, but his breathing had the rhythm of a man counting—perhaps tracking time, perhaps just staying sane.

Those too weak to crawl for their share simply went without.

One guard leaned over the hatch opening, grinning down at them. “Comfortable down there, are we? Don’t worry—journey’s nearly over. Then the real fun begins.”

A second voice drifted down from the deck. “How many you reckon will last past the first month in the mines, Garrett?”

“This lot?” Garrett spat into the hold. The glob landed near the dead merchant’s feet. “Maybe one in ten. Look at ’em—half dead already. Salt mines’ll finish what we started.”

“That scribe there won’t see a week,” the other guard observed with casual interest. “Betting pool says three days.”

“You’re generous. I give him till tomorrow’s shift change.” Garrett’s boot scraped against the deck planks. “Course, the strong ones sometimes last longer. Had one bastard make it half a year before the salt ate through his lungs. Kept working right up till he drowned in his own blood.”

Both guards laughed.

The dying scribe’s breathing hitched. His eyes had opened during the conversation, staring at nothing. A thin line of drool escaped the corner of his mouth.

Pell shifted beside Gond, his chains clinking softly. “Cheerful bunch,” he whispered.

“Salt mines,” Sim murmured, so quietly Gond almost missed it. “Alanyi have mercy.”

“Alanyi? That some kind of god?” asked Gond.

“Godess,” corrected Pell. “Our Sim here is a priest of this Alanyi, although I have to question her power if her priests make a habit of one-way trips to the salt mines.”

“Alanyi is the goddess of peace and mercy,” clarified Sim. “And I can’t think of many places needing mercy more than this one,” he continued with a lopsided grin. “Though I must admit, I’d much rather she’d sent me to a nice monastery than a slaver’s ship.”

Above them, Garrett’s voice carried clearly. “Captain says we’re making good time. Should reach Blackwater Bay by tomorrow evening. We’ll pick up more cargo there and then head to the mines.”

“Good. This cargo’s starting to stink. Lost two more since yesterday—that woman in the corner finally stopped breathing, and the old man by the bulkhead. Want me to toss ’em overboard?”

“Nah, leave ’em. Reminds the others what happens when they stop being useful. Besides, the smell keeps ’em docile.”

A boot kicked something metallic across the deck. “You know what I love about this job? No matter how tough they think they are down there, the mines break ’em all. Rich, poor, soldier, merchant—salt don’t care. It eats through everything.”

The conversation drifted away as the guards moved to other parts of the ship.

In the hold, silence stretched like a held breath. The woman in the corner had indeed stopped her lullaby. Her chest no longer rose and fell. The old man Garrett mentioned sat propped against the far bulkhead, his head drooping.

The dock worker beside Gond stared at his manacled hands. His thick fingers traced the iron links over and over, wearing a groove in the metal. “Ten months,” he whispered. “They say that’s the record.”

“Don’t,” Pell said quietly.

But the dock worker continued, his voice hollow. “My brother worked the quarries up north. Said the salt mines were worse. Said the air itself burns your throat, makes you cough blood after the first week. Said the tunnels go so deep you never see sunlight again.”

Jord’s chains rattled as he turned away.

“The overseers carry whips soaked in brine,” the dock worker went on. “Cut you open and pour salt in the wounds. Keep you working even when you’re bleeding out.”

“Stop.” Sim’s voice carried quiet authority.

The dock worker’s mouth snapped shut, but his eyes remained fixed on his hands.

Gond studied the hatch above. The guards had grown careless in their confidence. They saw cargo, not people. Merchandise that would be used up and replaced within months. The casual way they discussed death, the betting pools on survival times, the complete absence of any recognition that the people in this hold had once been human beings with names, families, lives—it painted a picture clearer than any threat.

A new voice joined the guards above—younger, uncertain. “Sir, should we check on the cargo? Some of them haven’t moved in hours.”

“What for?” Garrett’s voice carried amusement. “They’re not going anywhere. Dead or alive, they’re worth the same to the mine bosses. Actually, the dead ones are easier to handle.”

“But sir, if too many die before we arrive—”

“Boy, this is your first time on this run, isn’t it?” asked the older guard. “See, the mine bosses, they order by the shipload, not by the head. They know half’ll be dead by the time we dock, another quarter’ll die in the first week. That’s why they pack ’em so tight. It’s all figured into the price.”

Something heavy thudded against the deck above. “Speaking of which, time to check the other holds. Got two more shipments below deck. Want to make sure we don’t lose too many before we dock.”

Their footsteps moved away, but their voices carried back.

In the hold, the silence that followed felt heavier than before. The dock worker had stopped tracing his chains. His hands lay motionless in his lap. The soldier behind Gond had stopped his rhythmic breathing. Even the prayers in the corner had ceased.

Gond’s gaze drifted to the hatch. He studied the lazy way the guards moved, how they clustered together instead of watching properly. Sloppy. Overconfident.

He settled back against the hull, closing his eyes. Let them grow careless.

His lips curved in the barest suggestion of a smile.

   
 

# **Chapter 2: Breaking Chains**

The ship’s hull groaned like an old man’s bones, each creak marking time in their floating prison. Gond’s skull still felt like someone had used it for hammer practice, but the initial fog had lifted enough for him to think clearly. Around him, the symphony of misery played on—retching, whimpering, the constant rattle of chains.  
His tongue moved across cracked lips, tasting the metallic tang that lingered from whatever they’d used to drug him. *Badger’s bladder would taste better,* he thought, forcing himself to swallow the foul water when it came.

Days crawled by. Gond ate the slop they tossed down, drank the brackish water, and watched. Always watching. The guards grew lazier with each passing day, their routines as predictable as sunrise.

Jord shifted beside him for the hundredth time, chains clanking. The man’s shoulders bunched like a bull ready to charge, and his breathing came fast and shallow. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold.

“You bolt too early, we’re all feeding the fish,” Gond murmured, not looking at him.

Jord’s jaw worked silently, but he managed a jerky nod.

Behind them, Pell watched everything with eyes like a hawk tracking prey. His head turned at every footstep above, every change in the guards’ voices—the same predatory awareness that had kept him alive on the streets, reading the intentions of corrupt watchmen and brutal overseers. When he caught Gond’s attention, he tilted his chin toward the hatch.

“One of them keeps leaning too far over,” Pell whispered. “The greasy one with the gap teeth. Likes to wave his food around, make us watch him eat.”

Gond had noticed. The guard thought himself clever, dangling strips of dried meat just out of reach while prisoners strained against their chains.

“We wait for his shift,” Gond said.

Pell’s eyes glittered with something more than hunger. His weathered hands bore the calluses of rope work, and when he spoke of the sea, his voice carried the cadence of a man born to salt spray. “Know this stretch of coast like my own scars. Grew up working the fishing boats out of Millhaven before I found more profitable work.” The bitter edge in his voice suggested that ‘profitable work’ had come with its own chains—different from iron, but chains nonetheless. “Ship’s been angling northwest since yesterday. We’re coming up on Widow’s Cape—nasty bit of rocks that juts out like a broken finger. Captains always swing in close to avoid the deep currents beyond.”

“How close?” Gond asked.

“Close enough to swim, if a man’s desperate enough.” Pell’s grin was sharp as a blade. “And if he times it right. Third watch is when they make the turn—that’s when Greasy takes his shift.”

“Keep your god handy,” Jord muttered to Sim. “We’ll need more than pretty words.”

Sim’s mouth curved in the faintest smile. “She’s always listening.”

The planning began in earnest the next night, when the guards settled into their dice games and the hold fell into restless quiet. Gond shifted closer to his companions, chains scraping against wood.

“Listen carefully,” he breathed, his voice barely audible above the ship’s creaking. “We get one chance at this.”

Jord’s muscles coiled like springs. His fingers drummed against his thigh in rapid, nervous beats. “Just say when. I’ll tear through ’em—”

“You’ll tear us all into fish bait, more like,” Gond cut him off. “Greasy leans over the hatch every third watch. Always the same spot, always showing off his food.”

Pell’s eyes glittered in the dim light filtering down from above. “Twelve steps from hatch to rail on the port side. I counted. But there’s a coil of rope near the mainmast—could trip a man in the dark.”

“Good.” Gond’s mind worked through the sequence like a chess master planning moves. “Sim, when we pass you the keys, free as many prisoners as you can.”

“I will.” The priest’s voice carried quiet certainty.

“Take no more than 30 seconds to free the others, then follow us. We can’t save them all,” Gond said, the words tasting like ash. “Free as many as you can, but get to that rail within a minute or you’re fish bait.”

Gond held Sim’s gaze until the man nodded reluctantly.

“I’ll handle the crossbowman,” Gond continued. “Pell, you get the keys and free Sim. Jord—”

“I know what I’m doing,” Jord growled, his fists clenching and unclenching in steady rhythm.

“Do you?” Gond’s stare could have cut glass. “Because the moment you go up those stairs bellowing like a stuck pig, every bloody guard on this ship knows we’re loose.”

Sim placed a gentle hand on Jord’s arm. The big man’s breathing slowed slightly, though his muscles remained taut as bowstrings. “The river finds its way to the sea not through force, but through persistence,” the priest murmured.

“River water won’t stop a crossbow bolt,” Jord grumbled, but some of the tension left his shoulders.

Gond turned to the big man chained to his wrist. “Jord, you follow my lead. No charging, no roaring. We move fast but quiet until we’re committed.”

“And if it goes wrong?” Jord asked.

Sim’s smile was serene as dawn light. “Then we trust that Alanyi guides our path, whatever it may be.”

“Trust the goddess, but swim like your life depends on it,” Pell added with dark humor.

Gond felt the weight of their lives settling on his shoulders. Four men, bound by nothing but shared desperation and the chains that held them. In a few hours, they would either be free or dead.

The moment came three nights later. Greasy leaned far into the hold, waving a strip of salted pork just beyond Gond’s reach. “Hungry, are we? Maybe if you bark like a proper dog—”

Gond’s hand shot up, fingers closing on the guard’s rough tunic. One sharp yank, and Greasy pitched forward with a satisfying crack as his skull met oak planking.

“Now\!”

Pell moved like water, flowing over Greasy’s prone form to snatch keys and shortsword. Steel flashed as he freed himself, then tossed the keys to Sim, who caught them without looking up from his quiet prayers. Pell tossed the short sword to Gond as he climbed past appropriating the guard’s dagger for himself.

“Jord, *wait*—\!” Gond bit out, but the big man was already a blur of motion, roaring as he charged upward, chains whipping behind him like anchor rope. Shouts erupted from above.

“Gods-damned fool\!” Gond snarled, forced to race after him or be dragged down.

The deck exploded into chaos. Guards stumbled from their dice games, fumbling for weapons. Gond’s blade found the gap between one man’s ribs before the guard could clear his scabbard. The man folded over, hands clutching his side as he toppled into the rail.

“Over the side\!” Gond shouted over the rising din.

Pell appeared at his shoulder, his dagger work quick and merciless. Prisoners poured from below like water through a broken dam, some still trailing chains, all desperate. Gond saw Pell and Sim reach the rail and leap over.

Gond looked around and saw that the shouts had drawn attention. Four guards, armed and wary, were approaching from Jord’s left. Jord, intent on bashing the skull of the guard he had grabbed, failed to see death approaching. Gond butted the big man with his shoulder, moving him just enough that the nearest guard’s blow was fouled in the lines, but not before Gond received a sharp blow to his left shoulder.

“Get overboard\!” shouted Gond.

Then Gond and Jord were up and over. Cold water hit him like a physical blow, driving the air from his lungs. Almost before they hit the water, a crossbow string sang. Jord jerked, the bolt sprouting from his chest like a deadly flower. His eyes went wide, then dim. Slowly he began to sink, still chained to Gond’s wrist.

Gond felt himself borne down by the bulk of the big man. He felt an agonizing yank on his injured shoulder, and lost half a lungful of air from the stifled groan. The salt water burned his eyes and nose as he fought against Jord’s dead weight. Quickly, he brought his blade down on Jord’s wrist. Sawing desperately through sinew and bone, the water around them turning dark with blood. At last the hand was severed. Lungs bursting, pressure crushing his chest like iron bands, he struggled to reach the surface. His short sword tumbled away into the black depths as he clawed upward through the freezing water.

Gond’s head broke the surface and he took a gasping breath of cold air that tasted of salt and freedom. Around him, other bodies splashed into the waves—some went under immediately, dragged down by iron weights, their final gasps lost beneath the surface. Others surfaced, gasping and flailing, arms thrashing desperately against the pull of the sea. Crossbow bolts hissed through the air and struck the water all around the fleeing slaves with sharp splashes. He saw the woman who had been singing a lullaby struck in front of him, her eyes wide with shock before she sank immediately, the dark ocean swallowing her without a sound.

Twenty yards ahead, Pell and Sim swam with steady strokes, still wearing manacles but swimming strongly.

The shore seemed impossibly distant, but Gond forced his aching arms to move. Shoulder feeling like it was on fire, Gond found a stroke he could manage with his injury. Stroke after stroke, breath after ragged breath, until his knees scraped sand and he could crawl onto the beach.

He collapsed face-first into wet sand, lungs burning, every muscle screaming. Nearby, Pell rolled onto his back and actually laughed—a breathless, disbelieving sound.

“Well,” the rogue choked out, spitting seawater, “that went just… perfectly to plan, didn’t it?”

Sim lay beside him on the beach, his lips moving in what looked like prayers of gratitude. His shoulders shook, though whether from cold or relief, Gond couldn’t tell.

Gond’s stomach cramped violently, and he doubled over, retching seawater and bile onto the sand. The taste of salt and copper filled his mouth, remnants of the ship’s foul water mixed with his own blood from where he’d bitten his tongue during the swim. Each heave sent spasms through his already aching ribs and shoulder.

“Easy,” Sim said quietly, moving closer despite his own chains. The priest’s voice carried that same steady calm that seemed to ease Gond’s discomfort. “The body needs time to expel what doesn’t belong.”

When the retching finally stopped, Gond found Sim kneeling beside him with a strip of cloth he must have torn from his robe. The priest’s gentle hands cleaned his raw, bleeding wounds. His touch was warm against Gond’s ice-cold skin.

Hours later, Pell produced a rusty file from somewhere in his rags. The metal scraped against iron with agonizing slowness, each stroke sending vibrations through already raw wrists.

Once he was free, he passed the file to Gond. Gond’s hands shook uncontrollably—not from effort, but from the bone-deep cold that had settled into his marrow. His lips had gone numb, and his breath came in short, visible puffs despite the mild spring air. Pell took the file back.

“Hold still, damn you,” Pell muttered, teeth chattering so hard he could barely speak. His own fingers fumbled with the rusty file. “Gods, at this rate, we’ll grow old and die before these cursed things are off. Still better than drowning, I suppose.”

Sim waited patiently for Pell to hand him the file, but Gond could see the priest’s shoulders hunched against more than just the cold. The weight of the dead escapees pressed down on all of them, but on Sim more than the mercenaries who had seen their share of death. His hands trembled slightly as he worked the file—not from cold or exhaustion, but from something deeper. The violence of their escape, necessary though it was, seemed to cut at him in ways that went beyond the physical.

“Well,” Pell said finally, forcing lightness into his voice, “at least we’re not fish food. Though I’m starting to think the fish might have had the easier time of it.”

The joke fell flat in the grey morning air, but it served its purpose—a reminder that they were alive, that survival meant moving forward despite the weight of what they’d lost.

With the last manacle removed, Gond stood and brushed sand from his clothes. His legs still shook, his shoulder was throbbing, and the world tilted slightly with each movement, but he forced himself upright. Inland, Gond spotted smoke from a chimney, promising warmth and shelter.

He looked at his unlikely companions—the sharp-eyed mercenary thief and the gentle priest—and his chest tightened, then released, as if iron bands had suddenly snapped. Not quite trust, but maybe its distant cousin. They had bled together, suffered together, lost a friend together. That had to count for something.

   
 

# **Chapter 3 – Shore of Second Chances**

“Come on,” Gond said. “Our path lies ahead.”  
When his companions hesitated, he extended a hand to Pell, then moved toward the priest. “Cold kills slower than slavers, but it still kills.”

“And I want to get out of sight of any ships,” said Pell, eyes scanning the horizon.

Sim looked up, offering a nod. “Inland. Freshwater.” He pointed toward a gap in the dunes. “Fleabane and thrift cluster near streams—we can follow them to water.” His voice carried the quiet confidence of someone who’d spent years reading the land’s subtle signs.

Gond filed the information away. The priest’s knowledge kept surprising him—not the mystical nonsense he’d expected, but practical survival skills that spoke of a life lived close to the earth. He scanned the debris littering the shore. Barrels bobbed in the shallows, tangled nets draped across rocks, planks scattered like broken bones.

He selected a warped boathook, testing its weight. Pell snatched up a length of wood, shoving the crude club into his belt. Sim gathered barnacle-crusted gourds, shaking each one near his ear before nodding approval.

They followed the thin trickle of freshwater inland, through a narrow gully where the stream broadened into clear, cold water. Pell dropped to his belly and drank like a man dying of thirst. Gond sipped carefully, eyes scanning the ridgelines above. The coast had little more vegetation than sandgrass, scrub, and a few wind-twisted low trees. The lack of cover made Gond feel exposed. The smoke they had seen had come from somewhere beyond the ridgeline, a bit to the left of the trickling waterfall that fed into the basin. Gond again found the smoke, a wispy tendril smudging the grey sky.

The path they were on appeared to lead toward the source of the smoke. It climbed toward rugged cliffs, winding between wind-carved stones. Gond and his party followed it warily, eyes scanning the ridgeline. Just beyond the crest stood a small hut, weathered grey with a slate roof that seemed to blend with the slate hills in which it nestled. There they found the source of the smoke, trickling from the hut’s crooked chimney and carrying the scent of woodsmoke and herbs.

Before Gond could knock, the door swung open. An elderly woman stood in the threshold, spear held steady in capable hands. Her eyes swept over them—taking in their sodden clothes, makeshift weapons, the desperate edge that clung to escaped slaves.

“Names. Weapons down.”

Gond lowered his boathook. “Gond.”

“Pell.” The club hit the ground. His eyes never stopped moving, cataloging exits, weapons within reach, the woman’s stance—habits learned in alleys where a moment’s inattention meant death.

“Sim.” The priest spread his hands, empty palms facing outward. “We seek warmth and safety. We mean no harm.”

The woman’s spear didn’t waver. Her gaze lingered on each face, reading something in their expressions—the hollow look of recent captivity, the way they favored certain limbs, the telltale marks of shackle wear. Finally, she stepped aside. “One hour. No longer.”

Warmth enveloped them as they entered, along with the complex symphony of a healer’s workshop. Bundles of herbs hung from every rafter—some Gond recognized, others exotic and unfamiliar. Thyme and sage dominated, but underneath lay sharper scents: willow bark, feverfew, something that made his nose tingle. A grinding stone sat beside the hearth, its surface stained dark with years of use.

Sim’s eyes moved over the hanging bundles with quiet recognition, his gaze lingering on clusters of dried comfrey and what looked like wild garlic.

The woman—Maera, she said—moved with practiced efficiency. Her hands, weathered but steady, selected specific jars without hesitation. A small goat dozed in a woven basket near the fire, its breathing soft and even. Maps covered one wall, marked with routes and symbols that meant nothing to Gond but suggested extensive knowledge of the region.

Maera ladled steaming broth into wooden bowls, but not before adding pinches of dried herbs from different containers. The broth for Sim received something that smelled of mint. Pell’s got a bitter addition that made him wrinkle his nose. Gond’s bowl received the most attention—three different herbs, measured with the precision of someone who’d treated similar injuries before.

Gond’s hands shook as he lifted the bowl to his lips. The broth tasted of fish and wild onions, richer than any feast he could remember. Around him, Pell and Sim ate with the same desperate hunger, color returning to their faces.

Maera moved between them with efficient grace, binding Pell’s bruised ribs with strips of clean cloth, examining Sim’s blistered feet, cleaning Gond’s wound and the ugly brand on his forehead with a pungent salve that made his eyes water.

“You’re a healer?” Sim asked, watching her work.

“Served a temple in Blackwater once.” Her voice carried the weight of old disappointments. “Corruption outweighed compassion. Priests of Kemiss conducting slave auctions on the very temple steps, blessing chains with holy water.” Her mouth twisted with disgust. “Commerce became more sacred than mercy.”

Gond’s jaw tightened at her words. He’d seen those auctions himself—stood in the crowds, watched the bidding, told himself it wasn’t his concern. The priests’ blessing had made it all seem legitimate, ordained. Just another part of the world’s harsh order, like storms or drought. Something to endure, not fight.

*How many times had he walked past those temple steps?* How many branded faces had he ignored, convincing himself that one sword couldn’t change an empire built on human misery? The Guild’s reach extended into every port, every palace. Even the temples blessed their work.

He’d been a coward. Called it pragmatism, but it was cowardice plain and simple.

Maera glanced at Sim. “You’re not armed, while your companions are. Don’t you fight?”

Sim’s hands remained folded in his lap. “My path is mercy. I heal and guide.”

Pell snorted. “How’s a pacifist supposed to defend himself from slave catchers? Pray them to death?”

Sim’s eyes held steady calm. “Even the tiny field mouse will defend itself when attacked, and Alanyi blesses it.”

Maera leaned forward, her fingers pausing mid-stir over the pot. “Alanyi.” She repeated the name like tasting wine. “Haven’t heard that name spoken with reverence in years. Most prefer Turin these days—justice through strength, order through force.” Her fingers traced the rim of her bowl. “Easier to justify the trade when your god values order above mercy.”

“The trade?” Pell asked, though his tone suggested he already knew.

“Slavery.” Maera’s voice carried no emotion, as if discussing the weather. “Blackwater’s second-largest industry after fishing. Ships arrive weekly—some carrying goods, others carrying people. The docks have special pens now, built right into the harbor. Efficient.”

Gond’s knuckles whitened around his bowl. “And the temples bless it.”

“Of course they do. Kemiss blesses commerce, Turin blesses order, and both gods apparently smile on profitable ventures.” Maera stood, moving to tend the fire. “The salt mines always need workers. The quarries too. Most last six months, maybe eight if they’re strong. Short enough to be forgotten before anyone might come looking.”

“But some do come looking,” Sim said quietly.

Maera’s poker paused in the coals. “Some do. And some find what they’re seeking.” She didn’t elaborate, but her eyes flicked toward a small wooden box on the highest shelf—carved with intricate patterns that looked elven to Gond’s untrained eye.

“Heal and guide, eh? Then keep these two alive,” she said to Sim, returning to her seat. The corner of her mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close.

Gond set down his empty bowl. “We’re heading for Blackwater. I have business there. I’m looking for the men who betrayed me, and the inns there will be a good place to start. I’ve got scores to settle.” His voice dropped to a growl. “I intend to collect what they owe.”

Pell’s eyes brightened at the mention of the city. “Streets full of opportunity. Coin changing hands. Information for sale.”

“How far will we get with these brands?” Sim asked, touching his forehead where the slave mark would be visible.

Maera studied their faces with the calculating gaze of someone who’d made such assessments before. “Blackwater’s crawling with bounty hunters since the Crimson Company started offering rewards for escaped slaves. Two hundred fifty royals for a branded fighter.” Her eyes fixed on Gond. “More if they’re wanted for other crimes.”

Gond’s jaw hardened. “You seem well-informed about current bounties.”

“Information travels. Merchants talk. Fishermen gossip.” Maera shrugged, but Pell’s sharp eyes had caught something—her forced indifference suggested more than casual interest.

“There’s a pilgrim way-station southeast of here,” Maera continued, pulling out one of her maps and tracing over the coastline with a stick from the hearth. “This is us.” Then she pointed at a spot inland. “Old shrine to Alanyi, abandoned now. Stone walls, good water, hidden from the main roads. Travelers used to stop there for blessing and rest.”

“Used to?” Sim leaned forward.

“Still do, sometimes. Different kind of travelers now. People seeking… alternative routes.” Her meaning hung in the air like smoke. “The shrine’s been maintained. Supplies appear when needed. Food, blankets, medicine. Some say it’s divine providence.”

Pell snorted. “And others?”

“Others say there are still people who remember what mercy looks like.” Maera’s weathered hands pointed out more details on the map. “The way-station offers shelter, but it’s temporary. A place to rest and plan, not to hide. Too close to the roads, too well-known to certain… interested parties.”

She paused, her finger tracing the grotto where the way-station lay. “Though I’ll grant you this—that particular grotto is unusually well hidden. Slavers have never ventured into it, far as I know. Some say there’s a lingering blessing over the place, others claim it’s cursed.” Her eyes met Gond’s directly. “Don’t mean to tell you your business, but no blessing or curse will stop truly determined pursuit. The protection, whatever it is, won’t last forever.”

“And for permanent hiding?” Gond asked.

Maera’s stick moved north from the way-station, to a ragged range of hills. “The Thornwood Hills. Thirty miles inland, rough country. Caves and hidden valleys, game to hunt, streams for water. The terrain breaks up pursuit—supply wagons can’t follow, and most bounty hunters won’t risk the climb.” She paused. “But it’s harsh living. Winter kills the unprepared, and you’d be cut off from news, supplies, any hope of striking back at your enemies.”

Gond’s eyes fixed on the map. “Striking back.”

“Blackwater’s dangerous for branded men, but not impossible. The city’s grown fat on slave gold—guards can be bought, officials look the other way, and there are always shadows for those who know how to use them.” Maera met his gaze. “But the Crimson Company’s doubled patrols recently. They’re offering rewards for information. Your faces will be known.”

“You’re advising against it,” Sim observed.

“I’m advising caution. Revenge is a luxury the living can afford. The dead collect no debts.” Maera stood, moving to her shelves. Her voice neither rose nor fell, each word measured like coins on a scale. She selected several items—a small vial of dark liquid, strips of cloth that looked suspiciously like bandages, a pouch that clinked with the sound of coins. “But I don’t make choices for others. Each person walks their own path.”

She pressed a larger satchel into Sim’s hands—dried provisions, bundled herbs, and the additional supplies. “The way-station first. Rest, plan, decide. The hills will still be there if you choose them. Blackwater too, though it may choose you first.”

Maera then reached into a small, intricately carved wooden box on a high shelf—the same one Gond had noticed earlier, its patterns elven. She drew out a single, perfectly preserved silver-green leaf, its edges almost luminous. She pressed it into Sim’s other hand.

“A trifle,” she said, her voice softer now. “Something from the Elder Folk. A child’s game, mostly.” Her gaze met Sim’s, a flicker of understanding passing between them. “For you, priest, it may be more. Hold it, when you seek true sanctuary. It might… guide your hand.” She paused, a slight smile touching her lips. “And those who carry such tokens sometimes find the shadows cling a little closer, making them harder to follow. A small blessing, perhaps, in these dark times.”

Sim closed his fingers around the leaf. It felt cool and smooth against his palm. For an instant, as his skin touched it, he thought he saw a faint, pearlescent shimmer trace its veins, but it was gone as quickly as it appeared. He tucked it carefully into his tunic.

“You’ve helped others,” Gond said. It wasn’t a question.

Maera’s hands stilled on the satchel’s ties. “I’ve treated injuries. Offered directions. Shared what food I could spare.” Her voice carried careful neutrality. “Healers help the wounded. It’s what we do.”

“Even when the wounded are escaped slaves?”

“Especially then.” For a moment, something fierce flickered in her eyes. “The temples may have forgotten mercy, but some of us remember.”

Pell had been studying the maps on the wall during their conversation, his thief’s eye cataloging details. “Those routes,” he said, nodding toward the marked paths. “They don’t follow the main roads.”

“Pilgrims often prefer quieter paths. Less… crowded.” Maera’s tone remained neutral, but Gond caught the subtle emphasis.

“And the symbols?” Sim asked, pointing to the small marks scattered across the maps.

“Safe houses. Wells. Places where travelers might find aid.” Maera moved to the wall, her finger tracing one particular route. “This path leads to a fishing village where the captain asks no questions about passengers. This one to a monastery where the brothers practice true charity. And this…” She touched a symbol near Blackwater. “A tavern where the owner’s daughter was once sold to pay debts. He remembers.”

Gond studied her weathered face. “You know a lot about helping people disappear.”

“I know about helping people survive.” Maera returned to her shelves, selecting a small wrapped bundle. “Take this. Dried fish and journey bread. The way-station should have supplies, but…” She shrugged. “Sometimes supplies run low.”

“Who maintains it?” Sim asked. “The way-station.”

“Friends.” The word carried weight. “People who believe some things matter more than profit.” She handed Gond the bundle, and he noticed her fingers bore faint scars—old burns from forge work, cuts from blades. Not the hands of someone who’d spent her life only grinding herbs.

A soft whistle came from outside—three short notes, then two long ones. Gond and Pell’s heads snapped up, alert, hands darting toward weapons. Maera’s head turned toward the sound, and for just a moment, her careful mask slipped. Alertness sharpened her features, and for that moment she looked nothing like a simple herbalist.

“Fishing boats returning,” she said, visibly relaxing. “The tide’s turning.”

Gond exchanged glances with Pell, who’d caught the same details. The whistle hadn’t sounded like any fishing signal either of them knew.

“We should go,” Gond said, standing. “We’ve imposed on your hospitality long enough.”

“No imposition. But yes, daylight’s burning, and the way-station is a full day’s walk.”

Maera opened the door, checking the path outside with the practiced eye of someone who’d learned caution the hard way. “Go south until you reach the old oak with the lightning scar. Turn east there, follow the stream. You’ll find the way-station before sunset if you keep a steady pace.”

Outside, the wind had picked up, driving clouds across the grey sky. Gond adjusted his grip on the boathook, testing its balance. Behind them, the ocean whispered its endless secrets. Ahead lay Blackwater, uncertain and dangerous.

As they prepared to leave, Maera caught Gond’s arm. “The men you seek—Borin and Kael. Blackwater’s a large city, but the slave trade makes it smaller. Word travels fast in certain circles.” Her voice dropped. “If they’re there, they’ll hear you’re coming. Be ready for that.”

“You think they could be in Blackwater?”

“Men like that are drawn to easy money. And the slave trade’s been very profitable lately.” Her grip tightened slightly. “But remember—revenge is a fire that burns the one who carries it as much as the one it’s meant for. Sometimes the best victory is simply surviving to see another dawn.”

Gond nodded. This woman had seen enough escaped slaves to know the hunger for vengeance that drove them. Had probably seen what that hunger could do to a person.

“Thank you,” he said simply.

“Thank me by staying alive. All three of you.” Maera stepped back, but her eyes remained watchful. “The world has enough graves already.”

“We make an odd company,” Pell observed, adjusting his club in his belt. He had also wheedled an old but wicked-looking knife from Maera, which was tucked into the other side of the belt.

“Odd, but perhaps balanced.” Sim watched Gond carefully. “Sometimes the strangest alliances hold the strongest purpose.”

The words settled into Gond’s chest like stones dropped into still water. He looked at his companions—the warrior, the rogue, the priest. Three men with nothing in common but shared survival and the chains they’d broken.

He turned toward the inland path, eyes stony under jutting brows. He did not look back.

PART II  
*Seeds of Rebellion*  
   
 

# **Chapter 4 – Crack in the Chain**

The salt wind had teeth that morning, sharpening every sound that drifted across the northern bluffs.  
“The party up the trail,” said Pell. We’re catching up to them. “When we first found their tracks at the shattered pine back there, we were two hours behind. Judging by this dung, now we’re no more than an hour back.”

“This track is too narrow to skirt around them,” said Gond. “We’ll hold back until we reach the flats, then overtake and circle around in the night.”

Gulls shrieked overhead, but the familiar clamor seemed to fade as Gond saw something that made the hair on his neck stand.

Pell saw it too. Crouching at the edge of the trail where a thorn bush bowed toward the sea, he picked up a bit of cloth. “Ribbon,” he muttered, holding up a strip of frayed violet cloth. It fluttered like a wounded sparrow in the breeze.

Gond took it, rubbed the coarse weave between forefinger and thumb. *Children’s colors.* The thought knotted his stomach tighter than the sea‑spray chill. He scanned the ground: two sets of small footprints, one dragging slightly on the left.

Sim joined them, loose‑limbed and quiet as ever. “Carts?” he asked.

“Wagon,” Pell confirmed, pointing to deep twin ruts heading south toward the dunes. “Iron‑shod. Heavy.”

Gond’s brand felt hot on his head like fresh coals. Slave‑catchers were near, and children walked in chains. Six months ago he might have calculated the odds and walked on. Today he reached for the boathook slung across his back and felt only resolve.

“Pick up the pace,” he said grimly. “We’ll catch them right before they reach the flats.”

“Are you changing the plan?” hissed Pell. “We’ll be outnumbered, and they’ll be well armed while we’ve got a boathook and glorified kitchen knife between us.”

Pell stared at Gond’s set jaw, then blew out a breath. “Fine. Your funeral. Getting a bit dull ’round here anyway.”

 

**Laying the Trap**

The track narrowed where two limestone outcrops funneled travelers into a rocky choke point. Gond traced a quick map in the sand.  
“Pell, you slip upslope, circle wide, and cut the horses’ halters when I give the sign. Sim, keep the horses from bolting—quiet hands, calm words. I’ll talk our way close, then crack skulls.”

Pell’s grin flashed like a knife in the sun. “Missed this.”

They took positions. Gond stood alone in the center of the trail, feigning fatigue, head bowed so his ragged cloak made the boathook look like a simple walking staff. Moments later the wagon appeared: a stout coastal dray drawn by two bay horses, crates of salted fish stacked behind camping supplies. Two slavers rode the bench, bored and confident. A third trudged alongside the cart, whip looped at his belt like a sleeping viper, a crossbow slung across his back.

Behind the cart Gond saw them—*a girl, fourteen at most, dark curls matted with grime; a boy, perhaps sixteen, limping badly.* The girl glanced up, eyes blazing defiance even as she held her brother upright. Both bore the familiar slavers’ brand.

Gond raised a weary hand, slumping a bit. “Oi, friends\! Wheel’s busted on my cart, ’bout a mile back,” he called out, voice rough. “Any chance of a ride toward Blackwater?”

The lead driver leaned down, suspicion dawning too late. Gond’s boathook snapped up, catching the man under the jaw with a crack that echoed between the cliffs. The scene broke into chaos.

Pell burst from the grass, severing reins and slashing at the second driver. The horses bolted, but after a few dozen yards bent their necks to crop grass, oblivious of the bloodshed.

Steel rang. Gond ducked a clumsy saber slash, drove the boathook butt into a ribcage, pivoted, and swept the bench‑guard onto the road. Pell had a blade in him almost before he struck the ground. Gond turned to the third guard, who was fumbling at his crossbow. Gond charged, causing the guard to shoot wildly. The bolt flew wide, and then Gond was in reach. He swept the guard’s feet from under him, then two swift blows finished the job.

Silence descended on the clearing. The entire “battle,” if it could be called that, had lasted no more than 30 seconds by Gond’s reckoning.

“We’ll take the horses but leave the cart,” said Gond. “We’ll load the horses with whatever they can carry. And looks like the boy will have to ride.”

The children huddled together, ducking their heads and shivering.

Sim approached them with calming words. As he passed Pell, this one passed him a set of keys with a grin. Sim soon had the children free and was examining them for injuries, eliciting information.

Meanwhile Pell and Gond lined up the weapons they had recovered.

One slaver had been armed with whip, crossbow and dagger, while two carried standard mercenary blades, well-maintained but cheap—the kind of cheap weapon men carried when they couldn’t afford better. One of the swords was nearly black, more iron than steel by the look of it.

Gond’s fingers closed around the leather-wrapped hilt. The balance felt wrong, the weight distributed poorly, yet something about it called to him. He lifted it, testing the edge against his thumb. Sharp enough, despite its rough appearance.

“That one’s garbage,” Pell observed, hefting the other sword. “Take this one, it’s got better balance. I’ll keep the crossbow and dagger.”

Gond shook his head, sliding the dark blade through his belt. “This one will do.”

Pell shrugged, slinging the crossbow on his shoulder. “Your funeral.”

Sim set out to recover the horses, bearing a couple of carrots he had found among the supplies.

A sigh escaped Gond—then a crossbow string snapped.


**Complication in the Dunes**

Pain lanced across Gond’s upper arm; crimson soaked his sleeve. A fourth slaver—missed in the count—worked desperately at the crank, loading another bolt.  
Before Gond could pursue, the girl hurled the loosened chain lock. It whistled past the guard’s ear and clanged against rock, missing the man but startling him into dropping his bolt. Her act bought a precious instant; Gond seized it.

“Alia, stay with your brother\! Don’t move\!” he roared, already a blur of motion. Gond sprinted after the slaver, blood dripping past his elbow. Sand swallowed the noise of his footsteps; only the ragged sound of his own breathing marked the chase. Shortly he heard Pell’s rhythmic pants a few paces behind, but could not spare a look back.

Halfway across the first dune the slaver fitted another bolt into his crossbow, whirled, and fired again. The bolt hissed past Gond’s cheek, close enough to feel the wind of its passing. Adrenaline drowned the pain in his arm, and Gond mustered another burst of speed. The crude black blade he had claimed earlier rasped free of its sheath, rough iron glinting dully.

They clashed atop a wind‑carved ridge. The slaver fought desperately, edges of panic slicing his motions. Gond renewed his grip on the bloody sword hilt; parried, riposted, and disarmed him with a brutal twist. But as he raised his sword for a finishing blow the girl’s voice cut through the wind.

*“Don’t kill him\!”*  
Alia—he knew her name now—stood at the dune’s base, small hands balled, chin lifted. Behind her Dax leaned on a driftwood staff, blood seeping through a hastily wrapped ankle.

Gond’s blade hovered. In the staccato hush he heard his own breathing and, beneath it, the echo of forging hammers—of the life he’d left, lives he’d taken. He lowered the sword.

“Get out of my sight,” Gond growled, lowering the blade. “And if I ever see your face again…” He let the threat hang. The man scrambled away, dropping his crossbow, and vanished into the salt mist.

The air settled. Gond sank to one knee as fresh blood oozed from his arm.


**Refuge at the Way‑Station**

By twilight they reached the abandoned way‑station, moss‑covered walls glowing emerald in dying light. Broken statues of forgotten gods lined the courtyard, their faces weathered blank—judging neither the righteous nor the damned.  
Sim had coaxed the horses inside the crumbling stable. Pell stacked confiscated crates by the hearth, coins jingling in pockets he pretended not to have. He looked up as Gond entered, children at either side.

Inside the guardroom, Sim cleaned and rebound Gond’s wound. Alia hovered, handing fresh‑boiled cloths; Dax built the fire, hobbling about but feet seemingly recovering after riding the best part of the day.

“Ah, I almost forgot,” said Gond. “Alia—this ribbon must be yours.”

The girl accepted the ribbon worldlessly, holding it tightly.

Later, around a sputtering fire, Pell sketched a rough map in the dirt. “Patrol road runs here,” he said, dagger tracing a line intersecting the path they had used. “We’re safe enough for a night, maybe two. But they’ll be swarming like angry hornets once that bastard guard starts squawking.” He avoided Gond’s gaze.

“Pell, take the first watch,” said Gond. “And put that fire out before midnight. We saw how visible woodsmoke is in this country.” Pell nodded grimly.

Gond considered the children, the black sword resting beside his knee, the distant glow of Blackwater’s lights beyond the hills. “I’ll head to Blackwater alone before dawn. I’ll take one of the horses. If I’m not back by the following morning, take the children to Maera. She’ll find a place for them somewhere.”

“Understood, my friend,” said Pell. “Stay safe.”

“And you.”

Alia offered the ribbon back. “For luck,” she said.

“Keep it,” Gond said gruffly. “I’ll be back by tomorrow morn.”


**A Change of Plans**

The pre-dawn glow found Gond on a bluff above the way-station, studying their back trail. The morning mist clung to the valleys below, and through it he could see movement on the far ridge—a lone rider picking his way along the distant trail.  
Gond crouched lower, watching. The scout moved with purpose, eyes scanning the landscape methodically. His path would take him within a quarter-mile of the way-station’s grotto, close enough to spot any careless movement or telltale smoke.

But as Gond watched, something strange happened. The rider’s gaze swept across the grotto without pause, as if the ancient walls were invisible. He continued along the ridge, never once glancing toward their hiding place, though the morning light should have made the stone walls clearly visible.

Gond blinked, rubbing his eyes. When he looked again, the scout was already disappearing over the far crest, having passed them by completely.

*Whatever Maera said about this place being protected…* Gond shook his head, unsettled. He’d seen enough in his years as a mercenary to know when something wasn’t natural. But protected or not, they couldn’t rely on it forever.

He hurried down the bluff.

“Scout,” said Gond without preamble. “Might be a search party.”

Pell spat into the ashes. “How long before they decide to search the way-station?”

“I figure we’ve got a couple of days at most.” Gond studied the children’s faces—Alia clutching her ribbon, Dax testing his weight on his injured ankle. “Whatever’s protecting this place, it seems real enough. That scout should have spotted us easily.”

Pell’s eyebrows rose. “You believe Maera’s talk about blessings and curses?”

“I believe what I saw.” Gond’s voice carried grudging acceptance. “But I also believe what she said about determined pursuit. Use your judgment while I’m gone, but don’t trust to miracles.”

Pell’s grin was sharp as a blade. “Miracles? We used up our share of those escaping from the slave ship.”

Gond’s original plan had been simple: drop the children with Maera, let her network find them safe passage to distant lands. But with slave catchers scouring every trail…

“I was going to take you to Maera,” he said, kneeling to meet Dax and Alia’s eyes. “She has ways of getting people to safety. But with this many hunters…” He shook his head. “They’ll be watching her place, questioning anyone who comes near.”

Alia’s hand found her brother’s. “What does that mean?”

Gond’s jaw tightened as he made the choice that would change everything. “It means you’re coming with us. All the way to the hidden valley Maera told us about.”

Pell’s eyebrows shot up. “Gond, that’s—”

“Madness?” Gond stood, shouldering his pack. “Maybe. But leaving them here is death, and trying to reach Maera is a trap.” He looked at each face in turn. “Stay hidden. No more fires. Pell, use your judgement. If they start heading up to the way-station, set off. I’ll find you on the trail.”

Pell muttered something under his breath about collecting strays, but he was already checking his weapons. “Your call. But if we’re dragging children through the wilderness, we’d better move fast and quiet.”

Sim nodded approvingly. “The valley can shelter us all. And perhaps…” He glanced at the children with something like hope in his weathered features. “Perhaps that’s as it should be.”

   
 

# **Chapter 5 – A Change of Course**

Afternoon fog coiled around Blackwater’s northern gate like ghostly fingers as Gond observed from a few hundred yards out. Reaching down, he grabbed a handful of mud and smeared it across his forehead, then nudged his horse forward.  
Gond’s breath fogged in the chill air. He tugged his hood lower, concealing the brand that marked him as escaped property. The city’s walls loomed ahead, black silhouettes against the pale sky. His pulse hammered against his throat.

Three guards clustered by the portcullis, halberds gleaming in the lantern light. Their eyes sharpened as Gond approached. The oldest stepped forward, scarred face hard as granite.

“Hold there.” The guard’s voice carried the authority of a man who’d killed for less. “Name and business?”

“Rosan Vale,” Gond lied smoothly, adopting the weary slouch of a man beaten down by travel. “Horse trader from Cliffmere. Storm few nights back scattered my stock—only managed to recover this one. Not even a saddle.” He patted the cart-horse’s neck.

The second guard circled slowly, eyes taking in every detail. “One horse doesn’t make much of a trade. Papers?”

Gond’s stomach clenched. “Lost in the storm, along with everything else.” He slid three silver coins into the guard’s palm—more than the usual gate fee. “It’s what the storm left me.”

The coins vanished, but suspicion remained etched in weathered faces. The third guard stepped closer examining Gond’s face. He caught the mud smeared across his forehead before he could turn away.

“Horsing trading must be dirty work.” The guard’s hand drifted to his sword hilt.

“This one doesn’t look it, but he led me a merry chase.” Gond forced levity into his voice. “Clumsy me, landed face first in the mud chasing him down. I’d never live it down with the lads if they knew.”

The guards exchanged glances. The oldest nodded slowly. “Aye. Happens to the best of us.” But his eyes never left Gond’s face. “Welcome to Blackwater, trader. Mind the curfew—sunset to sunrise, no one moves without papers.”

Gond’s spine went rigid as he passed beneath the iron gate. Every step expected the shout of alarm that never came. Yet.

Inside Blackwater’s walls, the city stirred to life. Hawkers called their wares. Cart wheels rumbled over cobblestones. The air filled with the scents of bread and horse dung. But Gond felt eyes everywhere—whispers trailing him like smoke, curious glances that lingered too long.

At the market square, his worst fears materialized. A wanted poster fluttered against a wooden post. The sketch was crude but unmistakable—his face, his brand, clear as daylight. **WANTED ALIVE – 500 ROYALS**. More than double the standard bounty for escaped slaves.

A merchant glanced from the poster to Gond’s face. The man’s eyes widened, his pupils dilating as he took a sharp breath. His mouth opened to shout.

Gond stepped close, hand resting on his blade. “Might want to rethink that.” His voice carried the promise of violence. “Bad for business.”

The merchant’s mouth snapped shut. He nodded frantically and hurried away. But Gond caught him whispering to another trader, pointing in his direction.

More heads turned. Whispers spread like ripples in a pond. A city guard pushed through the crowd, hand on his sword. Gond melted into an alley, heart pounding.

The narrow passage reeked of garbage and piss. He pressed against the wall, listening to boots on cobblestones. The guard’s voice carried clearly: “…spitting image… five hundred royals… search every inn and stable…”

Gond cursed under his breath. The city was a trap, and it was closing fast. He needed to reach his horse and get out. But as he peered around the corner, his blood turned to ice.

Four guards surrounded his horse. One held the horse’s reins while another examined the bags strapped crudely on its back. A third guard waved the wanted poster, comparing it to something in his hand.

“He’s here somewhere,” said a guard. “Spread out. Check every building.”

Gond backed deeper into the alley. His horse was lost. There was no way to recover it. His jaw clenched. The animal had carried him faithfully, and now he’d led them both into a trap.

The alley opened onto a side street. Gond pulled his hood lower and joined the flow of morning traffic. But everywhere he looked, guards questioned merchants, checked faces against the poster. The net was tightening.

A shout erupted behind him. “There\! By the baker’s stall\!”

Gond didn’t look back. He pushed through the crowd, ignoring angry curses. Boots pounded after him.

He ducked into another alley, then another. The maze of Blackwater’s back streets offered temporary refuge, but he was trapped. The guards knew the city better than he did. They’d corner him eventually.

A wooden door stood ajar. Gond slipped inside, finding himself in a cooper’s workshop. Barrels lined the walls. Wood shavings covered the floor. The craftsman looked up in surprise.

“Shop’s closed,” the man said. “Come back—”

“Please.” Gond showed empty hands. “I need to hide. Just until dark.”

The cooper’s eyes narrowed. Then he glanced at the window, where guards ran past shouting orders. Understanding flickered across his face. “Escaped slave?”

Gond nodded.

The man studied him for a long moment. Then he pointed to a large barrel in the corner. “That one’s empty. But if they search here…” He wiped his hands on his leather apron. “Name’s Aldric, by the way. Figure if I’m risking my neck, we ought to know each other.”

“I know the risk.” Gond moved to the corner. “I’m Gond. Thank you, Aldric.”

The barrel reeked of old wine, but it concealed him completely. Through the wooden slats, he heard guards searching nearby buildings. Doors slammed. Now there was pounding on Aldric’s door. Voices shouted questions. The cooper answered calmly, claiming he’d seen nothing.

Hours crawled by. Gond’s legs cramped in the confined space. His back ached. But he forced himself to remain still, breathing shallowly. Outside, the search continued. Guards passed the workshop three times, but none entered.

As afternoon shadows lengthened, the activity gradually died down. The cooper tapped the barrel softly. “They’ve moved to the eastern quarter. But they’ve got men watching the gates.”

Gond climbed out, muscles protesting. “The walls?”

“Thirty feet high. Smooth stone. But there’s a section near the old temple of Alanyi where the mortar’s crumbling.” The cooper sketched directions on a wood shaving. “Wait for full dark. Guards change shifts at midnight.”

“Why help me?”

The cooper pushed aside his bangs, revealing a faded brand. “Twenty years ago, that was me in the barrel.”

Darkness fell like a shroud over Blackwater. Gond waited until the temple bells chimed midnight, then slipped from the workshop. The streets lay empty except for patrol guards with torches. He avoided their routes, keeping to shadows.

The old temple district squatted against the city’s western wall. Crumbling buildings leaned against each other like drunken beggars. Weeds pushed through broken cobblestones. The air smelled of decay and abandonment.

Gond found the ruined temple the cooper had described. Above the half-fallen archway he could barely make out the intertwined circles of Alanyi. Ancient stones showed gaps where mortar had crumbled away. Handholds, if he was careful. And desperate.

He tested the first stone. It held his weight. The second shifted slightly but didn’t fall. Inch by inch, he climbed. His fingers found cracks in the mortar. His boots scraped against stone. Every sound seemed loud as thunder in the night silence.

Halfway up, a stone shifted under his foot. Pebbles rattled down the wall. He froze, listening. Footsteps approached—a guard making his rounds. Torchlight flickered below.

Gond pressed against the wall, praying the shadows would hide him. The guard paused directly beneath, torch raised. Light played across the stones inches from Gond’s boots.

The guard moved on, muttering.

The footsteps faded. Gond remained motionless, muscles screaming, until silence returned. A bead of sweat dripped down his nose, falling on the stones twenty feet below. He forced himself to continue climbing. His arms trembled with strain. His fingers cramped. But the wall’s top drew closer with each desperate handhold.

A few feet from the top, Blackwater’s bells began to toll. The deep bronze notes rolled across the city like thunder. Alarm bells. The search had been expanded to cover the entire city.

Below, torchlight flickered back toward the wall. The guard’s voice carried clearly in the night air: “Search every shadow\! He’s here somewhere\!”

The torch began moving back along the wall’s base, growing brighter with each step.

   
 

# **Chapter 6: Whispers in Stone**

Gond surged up the last few feet of wall, muscles screaming as he hauled himself over the parapet. Below, a shout erupted from the guard who’d spotted his silhouette against the stars.  
“There\! On the wall\!”

More voices joined the cry. Torches converged on his position. Gond scrambled down the outer face, finding fewer handholds but driven by desperation. The ground rushed up to meet him.

He dropped the final fifteen feet, hitting hard and rolling to absorb the impact. Pain shot through his ankle like a blade, but he forced himself upright. Behind him, crossbow bolts sparked off the parapet where he’d been moments before.

Gond ran, favoring his injured ankle but moving fast. Ahead, a stream cut through the landscape, its banks lined with thick brush. Gond ran along the stream for twenty yards, then splashed into the calf-deep water, the cold shock driving away the pain for precious seconds.

Instead of following the stream away from the city, he doubled back, wading downstream toward where the water entered Blackwater through an iron grating. The current tugged at his boots as he pressed himself against the stone arch above the grating, hidden in the shadows.

Shouts echoed from the wall. “He went toward the stream\!”

“This way\! Follow the water\!”

Torchlight bobbed along the stream bank as his pursuers took the false trail upstream, away from the city. Gond counted their voices—at least six men, maybe more. They crashed through the brush like hounds on a scent, following his obvious path away from Blackwater.

He waited, pressed against the cold stone, until their voices faded into the distance. Only then did he climb down from the grating and circle around through the darkness, striking out for the hills that promised sanctuary.

The bells of Blackwater faded behind Gond as he limped north through the darkness. Each step sent fire through his twisted ankle, but he forced himself to maintain a steady pace. The alarm would bring mounted patrols within the hour. He needed distance.

The road stretched empty before him, a pale ribbon in the starlight. Without his horse, the journey back to the waypoint would take most of the night. Gond pulled his cloak tighter against the chill and settled into the rhythm of a forced march—the kind that had kept him alive through a dozen campaigns.

Every shadow might conceal an ambush. Every sound could herald pursuit. When an owl hooted in the darkness, his hand found his sword hilt. When wind rustled through roadside grass, he froze until the sound passed. The doubled bounty would draw every sellsword and bounty hunter within fifty miles. Five hundred royals could buy a man a farm, or a woman her freedom.

An hour into his journey, hoofbeats echoed from the south. Gond dove into a roadside ditch, pressing himself against the muddy bank as three riders thundered past. Torchlight flickered across their faces—city guards, riding hard. They didn’t slow.

He waited until their hoofbeats faded before climbing back onto the road. His clothes were soaked with ditch water, and mud caked his boots. The cold bit deeper now, seeping through wet fabric to chill his bones.

The road began to climb as it left the coastal plain. Rocky outcroppings provided better cover, and Gond used them, checking his back trail from each vantage point. No pursuit yet, but that would change with dawn. They’d find his escape route eventually, and then the real hunt would begin.

Dawn was breaking when he finally saw the way-station’s broken walls through the morning mist. Smoke rose from the chimney—a welcome sight that meant his people were safe. But as he approached, Gond noticed something that made him pause.

Fresh horse tracks circled the building. Too many tracks, from too many different horses. His hand found his sword hilt as he crept closer, using the ruins for cover.

Voices carried on the morning air—Pell’s distinctive laugh, Sim’s calm tones, and others he didn’t recognize. Gond circled to the back of the building, where a gap in the wall offered a view of the courtyard.

Relief flooded through him. The tracks belonged to a merchant’s pack train—five horses laden with trade goods, their owner haggling with Pell over the price of dried fish. The merchant was a weathered man with kind eyes, the sort who asked no questions about brands or bounties.

Gond waited until the merchant departed before revealing himself. Pell’s grin of relief was worth the cold, wet night of hiding.

“Thought they’d caught you for sure,” Pell said, clasping his shoulder. “Those bells rang for hours.”

Alia and Dax emerged from the shelter, their faces lighting with relief at Gond’s return.

“We thought…” Alia began, then stopped, shaking her head. “You were gone so long.”

“Blackwater is death,” Gond concluded, settling heavily beside their small fire. His ankle throbbed, and exhaustion weighed on his shoulders like a lead cloak. “They’ve doubled our bounty. Guards are searching every building, questioning every merchant. And they have the horse.”

Pell’s eyebrow arched. “What? How?”

“Surrounded him before I could get back.” Gond’s jaw tightened. The faithful horse had carried him through danger, and he’d repaid that loyalty by leading them both into a trap. “Which means they know we’re in the area. They’ll expand the search.”

“How long before they find us?” Alia asked, unconsciously moving closer to her brother.

“Days, maybe less—word travels fast when there’s gold involved.” Gond studied their faces in the firelight—frightened, hopeful, trusting. The weight of responsibility settled heavier on his shoulders. “We need to disappear. Deep into the hills where horses can’t follow.”

“Into thin air?” Pell’s voice carried forced lightness, but his eyes were serious.

“Into the wilderness.” Gond recalled Maera’s map, the careful marks she’d made showing safe routes and hidden refuges. “Too rugged for slavers. Too remote for bounty hunters. We hide, rest, plan our next move.”

Sim nodded, that calm certainty settling over him like a mantle. “Wisdom. Safety first.” He paused, stroking his beard thoughtfully. “There are older sanctuaries in these hills. Places forgotten by most.”

“Forgotten ruins sound perfect for forgotten people,” Pell muttered.

Dax flexed his hands, testing the strength that had returned to them. “I worked with my father’s carpentry crew before…” He gestured at his brand. “I know how to build, if we can find the materials. But we’ll need tools. Axes for felling trees. Saws for cutting lumber.”

“One problem at a time,” Gond said. “First we survive. Then we build.”

He looked around the circle of faces—frightened, hopeful, trusting. Something shifted in his chest. The weight of responsibility settled there, heavy but not unwelcome. These people depended on him. Their safety mattered more than his personal vengeance.

“Dawn, then.” His voice carried new authority, the tone of a man who’d made his choice. “We take the remaining horse and disappear.”

Pell’s grin held anticipation and wariness in equal measure. “Let’s hope hidden stays hidden.”

They broke camp before sunrise, moving with the quiet efficiency of people who understood that noise meant death. Whatever protection had shielded the way-station from casual discovery, it wouldn’t hold against a determined search. The mysterious concealment had bought them precious time, but Gond knew better than to trust their lives to blessings and curses.

Gond took the first turn riding their remaining horse, dozing in the saddle and resting his sore ankle. Soon he switched off with Dax, whose injured feet were healing well but still tender.

The path Sim chose led steadily upward, away from the coastal roads and into the wild heart of the hills. Ancient trails wound between towering pines and moss-covered boulders, paths that seemed more memory than reality. Soft drizzle whispered through the landscape, turning everything grey and ghostly.

“How do you know these ways?” Gond asked as they navigated a particularly treacherous slope.

Sim’s smile was gentle. “I wasn’t always a priest. Before Alanyi called me, I was… other things. A man learns the hidden paths when his life depends on staying hidden.”

They traveled in single file, Sim leading, Gond bringing up the rear. Every hour, he called a halt and climbed to higher ground, scanning their back trail for signs of pursuit. The guards would find the waystation eventually, but by then they’d be deep in country where a party with carts couldn’t follow.

During one such halt, Pell joined Gond on a rocky outcrop overlooking the path they’d taken. Gond’s eyes narrowed, tracing their passage through the damp earth and fallen leaves. “Odd,” he muttered, more to himself than to Pell.

Pell followed his gaze. “What’s odd? See something?”

Gond shook his head. “No, that’s just it. Our tracks… they’re fainter than they should be. Especially with the horse. Almost as if the rain’s washing them away faster than it ought to, or…” He trailed off, unable to articulate the subtle wrongness. Sim, who had been resting with Alia and Dax below, carried the small, silver-green leaf Maera had given him tucked securely in his tunic. Gond hadn’t given it much thought, but Maera had mentioned it might make them harder to follow.

Pell squinted at the barely discernible trail. A grin touched his lips. “Well, maybe we all just need to fatten up a bit, eh? Leave a proper mark for anyone curious enough to follow.” He clapped Gond on the shoulder. “Less work for you, covering our trail.”

Gond grunted, unconvinced. He made a mental note to observe Sim more closely.

The first sign of trouble came at midday. Smoke rose from the direction they’d come—campfires. From the direction and distance Gond surmised they were at the waystation.

“They’re so close,” Alia whispered, staring at the smoke.

The afternoon brought new challenges. The trail grew steeper, winding through narrow defiles where loose stone threatened to betray their passage. Dax struggled to stay mounted as the horse picked its way over treacherous ground. Alia began to stumble.

Gond called another halt, this time to tend wounds and redistribute supplies. They couldn’t afford to slow down.

“How much farther?” Alia asked, her face pale with exhaustion.

Sim consulted the sun’s position, then pointed toward a distant ridge. “Beyond that rise. An old temple of Alanyi lies in a hidden grove, sheltered by hills. We can rest there for the night.”

“Temple?” Pell’s voice carried skepticism. “I thought we were looking for a cave or a shepherd’s hut.”

“This is better.” Sim’s eyes held quiet certainty. “Nobody visits this temple. They think it’s haunted,” he smiled wryly.

They pressed on, the ridge seeming to retreat with each step. The drizzle turned to steady rain, soaking through their clothes and making the rocky path treacherous. Gond found himself constantly checking their back trail, expecting to see pursuit cresting each hill behind them.

As evening approached, they finally reached the ridge. The view beyond took Gond’s breath away—a hidden grove nestled among steep hills, green and peaceful in the fading light. Ancient stone walls emerged from the mist, partially hidden by climbing ivy and thick moss.

“There,” Sim said simply. “Sanctuary.”

The moment their horse stepped onto the temple grounds, its ears pricked forward and it released a soft whicker of contentment. Gond stopped, warmth spreading through his chest. The sensation was neither pleasant nor painful, just… puzzling.

The turf beneath their feet was different than the rocky ground they had been traveling over—thicker, greener. The air carried a fresh smell that contrasted with the dusty trail. Dax’s limp eased as he walked, and even Pell’s perpetual tension seemed to drain a little from his shoulders.

“Your goddess has strange tastes,” Gond muttered, though his voice lacked its usual edge.

Sim’s gaze lingered on the weathered stones. “This was a sanctuary. Once, such temples stood throughout the land. Now they crumble, forgotten.”

“Perfect.” Pell’s eyes swept the surroundings with a calculating gaze. “We’ll blend right in with the ruins.”

They moved quickly, establishing camp within the temple’s crumbling embrace. The fire caught on the first strike, and Gond saw tension draining from tired faces. Soon flames crackled in what had once been the main sanctuary, casting dancing shadows across broken columns.

Dax’s feet received Sim’s gentle attention while Alia helped prepare their meal. For the first time in days, no one glanced nervously at the horizon. The ancient walls seemed to offer more than physical shelter—they promised peace.

As the last light faded from the sky, Gond stood and stretched. His ankle still twinged, but it was barely noticeable. Around him, his people—when had he started thinking of them that way?—settled into the rhythm of evening camp.

“I’m going to scout the perimeter,” he announced. “Make sure we’re alone up here.”

“Want company?” Pell asked, though he was already settling back against a moss-covered stone.

“I’ll move faster alone. Keep the fire low until I get back.”

Gond set off through the ruins, intending to circle the temple grounds and check for signs of pursuit. But as he walked among the ancient stones, something else called to him. The warmth in his chest pulsed gently, like a second heartbeat.

   
 

# **Chapter 7: Awakening**

Gond continued exploring the ruins as the last light faded from the western sky. He’d intended to circle the temple grounds, check for signs of pursuit, ensure their sanctuary remained secure. But his feet seemed to have other ideas.  
Instead of following the outer walls, he found himself venturing deeper into the complex, through half-collapsed archways and overgrown courtyards. The path felt familiar, though he’d never been here before. Each step drew him forward with quiet insistence, as if the ancient stones themselves were guiding his way.

He paused at a junction of three passages, looking back toward the main camp. The fire’s glow was no longer visible through the maze of broken stone. How long had he been walking? The moon hung higher than it should have, and his intended circuit of the perimeter had become something else entirely.

The warmth in his chest continued to pulse gently. It had been there since they’d entered the temple grounds, a sensation that seemed to respond to his proximity to certain stones, certain carvings. Now it pulled him forward with unmistakable purpose.

Gond approached the weathered stones, studying the faded carvings that decorated every surface. Symbols of peace covered the walls—intertwined circles worn smooth by centuries of weather, hands raised in blessing, figures kneeling in supplication. He touched one carving, the damp stone cool beneath his fingertips. The warmth in his chest pulsed in response, stronger now.

A doorway loomed ahead, darker than the gathering dusk. His feet carried him forward without conscious decision, down worn stone steps that descended into the temple’s heart. The air grew warmer as he descended, carrying the scent of old incense and something sweeter—like wildflowers after rain.

The steps were ancient, each one worn smooth by countless pilgrims who had walked this path before him. Carved symbols lined the walls, growing more intricate as he descended. The intertwined circles of Alanyi appeared again and again, but here they were joined by other symbols—hands reaching toward light, trees with roots that became wings, figures dancing in eternal celebration.

A faint luminescence seemed to emanate from the walls themselves, or perhaps his eyes were adjusting to the darkness. The deeper he went, the stronger the sensation became—not quite light, not quite warmth, but something that touched both sight and feeling. The air itself seemed to hum with barely contained energy.

The chamber at the bottom took his breath away.

Unlike the ruins above, this room remained intact. Stone benches surrounded a simple altar, their surfaces unmarked by time or weather. Carved pillars supported a vaulted ceiling where faded murals still showed glimpses of their former glory—scenes of healing, of hope restored, of light conquering darkness. The air here thrummed with something he couldn’t name—not quite sound, not quite sensation. It was like a taste of starlight on his tongue.

Gond moved slowly through the chamber, his footsteps echoing in the sacred space. The benches were arranged in concentric circles around the altar, as if designed for communal worship. He could almost see them filled with pilgrims, their voices raised in songs of praise and supplication. The memory felt more real than imagination, as if the stones themselves remembered.

The altar drew him like a lodestone draws iron. It was pale marble, worn smooth by countless reverent hands. Symbols were carved around its base—the same intertwined circles he’d seen above, but here they seemed to pulse with their own inner light. Or maybe that was just his imagination. The warmth in his chest grew stronger with each step, until it felt like a small sun burning beneath his ribs.

He circled the altar slowly, studying the carvings that covered every inch of its surface. Here were scenes of Alanyi’s mercy—the goddess healing the sick, comforting the grieving, offering hope to the hopeless. The artistry was exquisite, each figure carved with loving detail that spoke of deep faith and reverence.

The compulsion to touch the altar grew stronger with each step. His hand reached out almost without his permission, palm hovering inches from the cool stone. The humming in the air intensified, and for a moment he could swear he heard voices—not words, but the memory of singing, of prayers offered in hope and desperation.

“What are you?” he whispered to the empty chamber.

The silence stretched, broken only by the distant drip of water somewhere in the darkness. Then, as if his words had been a key turning in an ancient lock, the warmth in his chest flared like oil hit by a spark.

His palm touched the marble.

The world exploded into light and sound and sensation.

The chamber blazed with golden radiance, every surface gleaming as if lit by captured sunlight. The murals came alive with movement and color—priests in white robes moving through the space, tending to the sick and wounded. The altar gleamed like captured starlight, and the air filled with the sound of voices raised in harmony.

Through the vision, through the overwhelming cascade of sensation, a voice spoke—not heard but felt, resonating in his bones and blood like the tolling of a great bell:

“You carry burdens willingly, Gond. Now carry hope.”

He staggered backward as if struck, his palm burning where it had touched the stone. The vision shattered, leaving him gasping in the sudden darkness. The chamber was cold marble again, nothing more than ancient stone and fading echoes.

But the warmth remained, spreading through his chest like wine. The voice echoed in his head, the memory of the voice fading but the words remaining, as if etched in his mind.

Gond sank onto the nearest bench, hands shaking. His heart hammered against his ribs, and sweat beaded his forehead despite the chamber’s chill. Exhaustion. Had to be exhaustion. The stress of leadership, the constant vigilance, the weight of lives depending on his choices. Visions were common enough among soldiers pushed too far.

Gond composed himself, forcing his breathing to steady and his hands to stop trembling. When he finally stood, his legs felt solid beneath him, stronger than they had in days. The chamber seemed smaller now, less overwhelming, as if whatever power had filled it had passed into him.

He climbed the worn steps slowly, each one carrying him back toward the world of fire and friendship, of responsibility and choice.

The main camp came into view as he emerged from the ruins. The fire had burned low, and most of his people slept peacefully around its dying glow. But Sim stood waiting at the perimeter, as if intuiting when Gond would return.

The priest’s head tilted slightly as Gond approached, his eyes narrowing with the focus of a man reading subtle signs. Sim’s gaze moved from Gond’s face to his hands, then back again, cataloging details with the precision of a healer assessing a patient.

“The ruins are… extensive,” Gond said carefully, testing his voice. It sounded the same as always, but something in his tone made Sim’s eyes sharpen.

The priest nodded slowly, his weathered fingers stroking his beard as he continued his quiet assessment. “Old places often hold more than stone and memory. They remember what they once were.” His eyes lingered on something in Gond’s expression that hadn’t been there before—a subtle shift in the set of his shoulders, perhaps, or the way he held his head.

Gond met the priest’s eyes, searching for judgment or expectation. He found only patient understanding, as if Sim knew exactly what had transpired in the depths below but would wait for Gond to speak of it in his own time. The priest’s hands remained still at his sides, but his breathing had deepened slightly—the posture of a man who sensed change but would not press for answers.

They stood in comfortable silence, watching the stars wheel overhead. Around them, the refugees slept peacefully under the protection of ancient walls. The warmth in Gond’s chest pulsed gently, and he found himself wondering what other changes were stirring within him—changes he could feel but not yet name.

That night sleep eluded Gond, as he went over the experience in his mind. The longer that passed, the more the-voice? sending?-seemed to recede, like a dream, as if his mind was walling it off.

Somewhere in the ruins, wind sighed through broken stone, carrying what might have been laughter—or perhaps just the echo of his own wry amusement. But the warmth in his chest pulsed steadily, like a beacon in the darkness, and Gond found himself smiling as sleep finally claimed him.

   
 

# **Chapter 8: The Valley of Hope**

The journey from Alanyi’s hidden temple to the valley Maera had spoken of took them the better part of a week. The terrain grew wilder, the paths less certain. Sim, however, seemed to navigate with an uncanny sense of direction. Several times, when Gond found himself doubting their course through a dense thicket or a confusing maze of ravines, he would see Sim pause, head tilted as if listening to some distant whisper. The priest would often draw out the silver-green leaf Maera had given him, holding it cupped in his palm.  
One afternoon, as they rested in the shade of an ancient, gnarled oak, Gond watched Sim with the leaf. The priest held it out, turning it slowly. As the leaf pointed towards a distant, unseen cleft in the mountains, a soft, pearlescent light pulsed from its veins, so faint Gond might have dismissed it as a trick of the dappled sunlight. But the light was steady, a gentle thrum against Sim’s skin. Sim nodded to himself, a quiet smile touching his lips, and then tucked the leaf away. When they resumed their march, he led them towards that cleft with renewed confidence. The way, though still arduous, seemed to open before them more easily, as if the very land consented to their passage.

Finally, after days of trudging over steep hills, the land opened suddenly into a wide valley sheltered by towering cliffs. A narrow waterfall tumbled down one sheer wall, pooling into a lake so clear Gond could see the bottom twenty feet down. Green grass carpeted the valley floor, dotted with wildflowers and fruit trees gone wild. The band quickly set up camp and started setting up a more permanent encampment.

To the surprise of Gond, Dax took the lead in constructing the encampment. He had been an apprentice carpenter, and in fact his family had been traveling to a nearby city to submit his master-work when they were attacked by raiders. Having a purpose seemed to energize Dax, and to Gond, watching him break out of his shell and join the men in their work reminded him of a fresh recruit working his way up to full soldier.

A week after they reached the valley, the first of the refugees arrived.

She said her name was Lira, an escaped slave who looked no more than eighteen. Her dark hair hung in matted tangles around a face hollowed by hunger, and fresh cuts marked her arms where shackles had rubbed raw. She limped badly, favoring her left leg, and barely made it to the valley’s edge before collapsing.

“Maera sent me,” she gasped, her breath catching in ragged sobs as Sim knelt beside her with water and gentle hands. Her fingers, raw and trembling, fumbled at the neck of her ragged tunic and drew out a silver-green leaf, clutched so tightly its edges had creased. She held it out, a desperate offering. “She said… show this. That it would prove… I am who I say. That you would know I was sent by one who helps.” The leaf lay on her dirt-stained palm, seemingly ordinary, yet her eyes clung to it as if it were a sacred relic. “She said there were… people like me here.”

Her story emerged in fragments as Sim tended her wounds. Her father had sold her into slavery to pay for debts, but she had relatively easy work as a kitchen maid in a merchant’s house. But she was caught stealing bread for her sick mother, and the magistrate decided to make an example by sending her to the salt mines. She had escaped just before the guards came to claim her, and had been on the run for two weeks.

But Lira had skills that had kept her alive. “My father taught me to hunt before he sold me for his debts,” she said, wincing as Sim cleaned a particularly deep cut. “Tracked deer through forests thicker than this. Knew how to move quiet, how to read signs.” Her eyes held a fierce pride despite her exhaustion. “That’s how I made it here alone.”

Pell emerged from the shadows, studying the newcomer with calculating eyes. “Another stray,” he muttered, but without real malice. “We’ll be running a proper refuge soon.”

Gond found himself stepping forward before he’d made a conscious decision. Something about the girl’s determination, her refusal to surrender despite everything she’d endured, called to him. “She stays,” he said simply. “Anyone Maera sends is welcome here.”

The words felt right in his mouth, weighted with certainty he didn’t fully understand. Around the fire, the others voiced their agreement, and Gond saw something shift in their faces—a recognition of his authority that went beyond mere survival.

After that, refugees continued to arrive in ones, twos, and threes, with similar stories for the most part: escaped slaves, peasants fleeing cruel masters, apprentices put out by their masters. Many of them carried the same silver-green leaf that Sim and Lira had. Another commonality to all the refugees was the name they mentioned: Maera. She was sending refugees on to them. Where she sent them before nobody knew.

Sim took charge of the refugees, arranging shelter, and giving them tasks to keep the group fed and prepare for the coming seasons.

Three weeks after finding the valley, Gond, Lira and Pell were out hunting a day’s march from the valley. When Pell started down what appeared to be a clear trail, Gond’s hand shot out, stopping him. Bird calls had shifted to warning silence, and his shoulders tensed as if invisible hands had gripped them. The hair on his arms stood on end.

“Wait.”

Pell frowned, scanning the area. “Looks clear to me.”

“Just wait,” repeated Gond. “There’s something…”

Within minutes, dust clouds appeared on the horizon. An armed party, moving fast along the very route Pell had suggested.

“How did you—” Lira began.

“Lucky guess.” Gond was already moving, leading them through dense thickets that tore at their clothes but kept them hidden. “Years of staying alive in hostile territory.”

Lira looked unconvinced. She shot a glance at Pell, who merely shrugged and followed after Gond.

They found an alternate route through brambles and broken stone. Back at the encampment, as evening approached, Lira and Korven—a surly man who’d joined them two days prior—squared off over their dwindling food supplies. The other refugees formed a loose circle around them, some nodding agreement with Lira, others crossing their arms and scowling in support of Korven.

“Children eat first,” Lira insisted, her voice rising with each word. “That’s how decent people behave.”

“Decent people don’t survive long.” Korven’s hand drifted toward his knife. “Strong eat, weak starve. That’s nature.”

Other refugees began choosing sides, voices rising, hands moving toward weapons. The fragile unity of their group cracked like thin ice. Dax stepped protectively in front of his sister, while an older woman clutched her shawl tighter and backed away from the confrontation.

Gond stepped between them. When he spoke, his voice seemed to settle over the entire group like a soothing balm.

“Enough.”

The single word hung in the air. Korven’s hand froze halfway to his blade. Alia’s mouth closed with an audible snap. Even the children stopped their restless fidgeting. The refugees who had been edging toward the argument now stood perfectly still, their eyes fixed on Gond with the attention of people recognizing authority they hadn’t expected to find.

“We share what we have, or we all starve together.” Gond’s eyes moved from face to face, holding each gaze until they looked away. “Korven, you take first watch. Everyone else, you know your jobs.”

The argument died as if it had never been. Korven nodded curtly and moved to his assigned position. Lira gathered the children and began tending them. The others dispersed to their tasks, the tension evaporating like morning mist. Several refugees glanced back at Gond with expressions of relief and something approaching reverence.

Pell appeared at Gond’s elbow as they settled for the night. “That was… interesting. Since when do you command that kind of authority?”

“Since I started making sense instead of noise.” But even as Gond spoke, he wondered at how easily the conflict had resolved. The words had felt right in his mouth, weighted with certainty he didn’t understand.

A few evenings later, one of the newer refugees—a man named Jorik—took a turn for the worse. Fever burned through him, and angry red lines spread from a festering wound on his arm. Sim worked tirelessly, applying herbs and murmuring prayers, but the infection was winning.

Gond knelt beside the dying man without conscious thought. His memory of the temple stirred, and he felt that he must touch Jorik.

“I don’t think—” Sim began, then stopped as Gond placed his hands on Jorik’s burning forehead.

Gond sent a silent plea to Alanyi. *Please-*

Gond felt nothing, but watched as Jorik’s labored breathing gradually eased. The man’s chest, which had been rising and falling in rapid, shallow gasps, began to slow and deepen. Sweat beaded on his forehead, then began to dry. Within an hour, Jorik’s eyes fluttered open, clear and focused, and he pushed himself up on his elbows asking for food.

“Remarkable recovery.” Sim’s voice was carefully neutral. “The herbs work swiftly when properly applied.”

Gond nodded, accepting the explanation like a lifeline. “Your goddess has good timing.”

But privately, he flexed his fingers, half-expecting to see some visible sign of change. They looked the same as always—scarred, callused, ordinary. Yet the memory of that voice in the temple lingered, and with it, questions he wasn’t ready to ask.

That night, during his watch, Gond found himself studying the sleeping faces around their fire. When had he become the one they looked to for answers? When had their survival become his responsibility?

Soft footsteps announced Sim’s approach. The priest settled beside him on the rocky ledge, gazing out at the star-filled sky.

“Troubled thoughts?”

“Just wondering how we got here.” Gond kept his voice low. “Few weeks ago, I was a sellsword with no responsibilities beyond my next meal. Now…”

“Now you carry the hopes of two dozen souls.” Sim’s voice held no judgment. “Heavy burden.”

“One I never asked for.”

“The best leaders rarely do.” The priest was quiet for a moment. “Alanyi often chooses those who are reluctant to serve. Perhaps because they understand the weight.”

Gond glanced at him. “You really believe your goddess is involved in this?”

“The smallest seed can grow into the mightiest oak, given proper soil.” Sim’s smile was gentle in the starlight. “Sometimes strength comes from unexpected places.”

   
 

# **Chapter 9: Sanctuary Found**

Word had apparently continued to spread through Maera’s network, and the trickle of refugees remained steady. Each new face brought both hope and concern—more mouths to feed, more lives to protect, but also more hands to build their sanctuary.  
Gond began to notice patterns in their arrivals. The refugees found them too easily, following trails that should have been impossible to track. He knew that if the refugees found them this easily, slave catchers would too. And the refugees would be leading them right to the valley. Still, he couldn’t bring himself to turn away desperate souls seeking shelter.

Slowly, the mood of the group transformed into something approaching hope. Sim welcomed the newcomers, organizing work parties with quiet efficiency. Pell took charge of the horses, fashioning crude sledges from rope and timber to haul supplies.

“These beasts are worth ten men,” Pell noted, patting one horse’s sturdy flank as it dragged a load of freshly cut timber toward the growing cluster of shelters.

The sound of axes biting into wood echoed across the valley as Dax led a crew of refugees in felling trees for construction. His carpentry skills had proven invaluable—within days of their arrival, he’d identified the best timber and organized cutting crews. “Pine for the frames,” he called to a group hauling logs. “Oak for the load-bearing posts. And save those birch branches—we’ll need them for roofing.”

Sim moved tirelessly among the injured and weary, his gentle touch and soft prayers bringing order to chaos. Alia, energized by safety, took charge of foraging together with the other children, their youthful enthusiasm infectious. Lira revealed an unexpected talent for organization, creating order from their scattered belongings.

Among the newest arrivals, Gond had begun identifying useful skills. Korven, a grizzled man with burn scars covering his arms, had worked iron before his enslavement. “Give me a forge and some bellows,” he’d said, examining their meager collection of tools, “and I can make what we need. Nails, hinges, proper blades.”

An older woman named Marta had sewn sails for fishing boats. Her weathered hands could work leather and canvas with equal skill. “Proper tents,” she’d muttered, studying their makeshift shelters. “Waterproof. These lean-tos won’t survive the first real storm.”

The sound of hammering had joined the axes as refugees fashioned tools from salvaged metal. A broken cart wheel became iron bands for reinforcing timber. Bent horseshoes were straightened into nails. Every scrap of metal was precious, every skilled hand invaluable.

Throughout the valley, Gond’s name echoed quietly. When disputes arose over work assignments, people sought his judgment. When questions needed answers, they turned to him. It seemed that Gond’s mere presence was enough to calm tempers and turn anger into smiles. Gond found himself at the center of every decision, the focal point around which their small community revolved.

Increasingly, people began to notice strange manifestations of some kind of power in Gond. One night, he had his sword out for maintenance—oiling and polishing. He had noticed the quality of the metal increasing gradually since his experience at the temple.

Pell seemed to take notice too. “I could have sworn that old pig sticker of yours was plain iron,” he joked. “More suited for hoeing turnips than fighting. But that blade is pure sword-steel or I’m a three-legged mule.”

“Just proper maintenance—oiling and polishing bringing out the sword’s own qualities,” replied Gond. “You should try it on your own sword.”

“If I could turn iron into steel by oiling and polishing, I’d be fat and rich.”

On one particularly nice evening, Gond addressed the group. “We’ve found our sanctuary.” His voice carried quiet authority. “But safety isn’t guaranteed. We must stay vigilant, ready to defend this home.”

Pell stepped forward, arms crossed. “We should fortify the entrance to the valley. Make it defensible, discreet. Traps if needed.”

Sim nodded. “We build a community of hope, but prepare wisely for those who would destroy our peace.”

Murmurs of agreement rose from the gathered refugees, voices strengthening with resolve. Gond watched their faces, something swelling in his chest, not pride, but satisfaction, maybe.

“We each have a role.” His gaze moved from face to face, holding each one. “Together, we survive. Together, we thrive.”

In the quiet hours before dawn, Gond stood watch atop the valley’s highest ridge. Below, the fledgling community slept peacefully.

“It’s a good start,” Pell murmured, joining him in the darkness. “But slavers won’t ignore us forever.”

Gond nodded, his jaw set. “Let them come. They’ll find more than frightened fugitives here.”

Pell’s lips curved in a fierce grin. “Then we’ll show them what desperate people can do when they have something worth protecting.”

Below them, the first rays of dawn touched their hidden valley with gold. Gond felt something settle deep in his chest.

The next day, Pell and Gond-the only members of the group with any military experience-began training the able-bodied refugees in defense. Gond, knowing he had neither time nor weapons for proper military training, focused on teaching pike work-both because pikes provide strong defense against mounted foes and because they enable many inexperienced defenders to group up on a single enemy.

A week later, the first real crisis struck.

Gond crouched beside the dwindling pile of grain sacks, his jaw tight as he counted what remained. Around him, the morning bustle of the camp continued—children playing by the lake, adults tending fires and mending clothes—but the numbers didn’t lie. At their current rate of consumption, they had perhaps ten days of food left.

“How bad?” Pell asked, appearing at his shoulder.

“Bad enough.” Gond straightened, brushing dust from his hands. “We need to send foraging parties farther out. The valley’s resources won’t sustain fifty people.”

Sim approached, his face grave. “I’ve been thinking the same. The fruit trees are nearly stripped, and the fish in the lake are growing scarce.”

“And too late in the season to plant,” added Pell.

“Come fall we’ll be able to gather enough acorns, nuts and berries to tide us until spring. But until then…” Sim trailed off.

The three men stood in uncomfortable silence, each understanding the implications. Larger foraging parties meant greater risk of discovery. But without food, their sanctuary would become a tomb.

“There’s something else,” Sim said quietly. “The new arrivals yesterday—they brought troubling news.”

Gond turned his full attention to the priest. “What kind of news?”

“Smoke on the horizon. Three days’ travel south of here. Thick, black columns that lasted for hours.” Sim’s voice dropped lower. “The kind that comes from burning villages.”

A chill ran down Gond’s spine despite the morning warmth. “Systematic raids?”

“That’s what it sounds like. It’s like their clearing out the whole region. Any foraging parties will be hard to conceal.”

Pell cursed under his breath. “So we’re caught between starvation and discovery. Perfect.”

Gond paced a tight circle, his boots wearing a path in the dirt. His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides as he weighed their choices, none of them good. They could ration more strictly, but hungry people made poor fighters. They could send small, stealthy foraging parties, but that would take too long to gather enough supplies. Or they could risk a major expedition to the abandoned farmsteads two days south—closer to the smoke, closer to danger, but with the potential for significant food stores.

He stopped abruptly, jaw set with decision.

“Gather the council,” he decided. “Lira, Korven, and the other group leaders. We need to make a choice, and everyone needs to understand the stakes.”

An hour later, the leadership circle sat around the central fire pit, their faces reflecting the gravity of the situation. Gond laid out their predicament with brutal honesty—the food shortage, the approaching threat, the impossible choice between risk and starvation.

“I say we take the risk,” Korven declared, his scarred hands clenched into fists. “Better to die fighting than waste away.”

“Easy words from someone without children to protect,” Lira shot back. “You’re talking about sending people into slaver territory.”

“We’re already in slaver territory,” Pell pointed out quietly. “The question is whether we face that reality now or wait for it to find us.”

The debate continued for nearly an hour. Korven’s scarred fists pounded a tree stump to emphasize his points, while Lira crossed her arms and turned her back when he spoke. Others shifted restlessly, some nodding at Korven’s words, others shaking their heads and moving closer to Lira. Voices rose and fell as fear and desperation warred with caution and hope. Gond listened to each argument, watching faces tighten with worry and hands gesture frantically as they weighed options that all seemed to lead toward disaster.

Finally, he raised his hand for silence. “We go. Tomorrow at dawn, I’ll lead a party to the Thornfield farmstead. It’s been abandoned for weeks—the refugees who told us about it said the family fled when the raids started. Their root cellars might still be intact.”

“How many?” Pell asked.

“Twelve. Enough to carry significant supplies, few enough to move quietly.” Gond’s gaze swept the circle. “Volunteers only. No one with children under ten. No one who can’t run if we need to.”

Sim leaned forward. “The smoke they saw—how far from Thornfield?”

“Close enough to be dangerous. Far enough that we might have a chance.” Gond stood, his decision made. “We leave before dawn. We’ll travel fast, raid the farm that night, load what we can find, and get back before nightfall the next day. Two days, in and out.”

As the council dispersed to spread word of the expedition, Gond found himself staring south toward the horizon. Somewhere out there, smoke still rose from burning homes. Somewhere out there, slavers moved with methodical precision, destroying everything in their path.

And tomorrow, he would lead his people directly toward that danger.

The irony wasn’t lost on him. A week ago, he’d promised them sanctuary. Now he was asking them to risk everything on a desperate gamble for survival.

“Second thoughts?” Pell asked, settling beside him on the rocky outcrop.

“Third and fourth thoughts,” Gond admitted. “But the alternative is watching them starve.”

“Could be walking into a trap. Could be the farmstead’s already been hit.”

“Could be.” Gond’s hand moved unconsciously to his sword hilt. “But we won’t know until we look.”

Pell nodded slowly. “Then we’d better make sure we’re ready for whatever we find.”

As evening fell over the valley, Gond stood before the assembled refugees once more. But this time, instead of promises of safety, he offered them truth—harsh, uncompromising, and necessary.

“Tomorrow, some of us risk everything so all of us can survive,” he said, his voice carrying to every corner of the gathering. “That’s what family does. That’s what we’ve become.”

The faces looking back at him showed fear, yes, but also determination. Gond gave a satisfied nod.

Two days later, the expedition returned with more than just food.

The weary but triumphant party picked their way down the valley’s narrow entrance, leading the community’s horses—they now had four, including the old cart horse Gond and his companions had stolen in their first caravan raid. Each horse was pulling a fully laden sledge, the expedition’s members grunting and straining to help the sledges over roots and boulders. The Thornfield farmstead had yielded better than expected—not just grain and preserved meat from the root cellars, but tools and materials the fleeing family had been forced to abandon.

“Ten sacks of potatoes, five sacks of oats, and another five of wheat,” Gorn told the waiting refugees, dismounting with obvious relief. “Enough to last us another month and a half, maybe more if we’re careful. Plus salt pork, dried beans, and a barrel of honey.”

“And the rest?” Sim asked, noting the bundles strapped to every available surface.

Korven stepped forward, his scarred hands cradling a collection of iron tools like precious treasures. “Proper hammers, tongs, files. A set of chisels that’ll let me work real detail into the metal.” His eyes gleamed with anticipation. “And three ingots of good steel—not the scrap we’ve been melting down, but proper forged metal.”

Dax emerged from behind one of the horses, struggling with a heavy bundle. “Carpenter’s tools,” he said, setting down his burden with a grunt. “Saws, planes, measuring squares. And enough iron nails to build proper structures instead of lashing everything together with rope.”

Within days, the valley echoed with new sounds. Korven’s hammer rang against steel in steady, confident strikes—no longer the tentative tapping of makeshift repairs, but the bold rhythm of a craftsman with proper tools. Sparks flew in bright arcs as he shaped red-hot metal, and the acrid smell of hot iron mixed with wood smoke.

From his forge came a steady stream of improvements: iron-reinforced spear points to replace sharpened sticks, proper hinges for doors that had hung crooked on leather straps, and cooking pots with handles that didn’t burn hands. He crafted horseshoes for their mounts, whose hooves had been splitting on the rocky ground, and sturdy buckles to replace the rope knots that held their makeshift armor together.

Dax’s crews moved with fresh purpose, their crude lean-tos giving way to solid timber frames. Where before they had lashed logs together with rope, now they fitted joints with precision—no longer the tentative tapping of makeshift repairs, but the bold rhythm of a craftsman with proper tools. Doors hung straight, roofs shed rain instead of leaking, and storage chests protected their meager possessions from moisture and vermin.

“It’s amazing what a difference real tools make,” Lira observed, watching a crew raise the frame of what would become their first permanent storehouse. “We’re not just surviving anymore. We’re building something that could last.”

Gond nodded, but his eyes were already turning toward the horizon. The Thornfield expedition had proven something important—that the abandoned settlements held resources they desperately needed. And if one farmstead could yield so much, what might they find in the ruins of larger communities?

The question would have to wait. For now, they had food, tools, and hope. It was enough to keep them alive, and strong enough to face whatever came next.

   
 

# **Chapter 10: Hunters and Hunted**

The next morning dawned hot and sultry. The cicadas were already producing their summer cacophony by the time Gond’s party had cleared the valley.  
The horses’ hooves made soft sounds on the damp earth, as they whickered gently. Behind him, the volunteers moved with the quiet discipline he’d drilled into them—Pell, Korven, Lira, and nine others whose families depended on this mission’s success.

The Thornfield farmstead lay a day’s march south through increasingly dangerous territory. Every step took them closer to the smoke columns they’d seen on the horizon, closer to the systematic destruction that crept northward like a plague.

They reached the hills above the farmstead, and began looking for a place to hide and wait for nightfall.

Gond’s shoulders tensed without warning, as if invisible hands had gripped them. The hair on his arms stood on end. He raised his hand, bringing the column to a halt. Something had changed in the air around them—a subtle shift that made his skin prickle with warning. He dismounted, checking the trail.

“What is it?” Pell whispered, sliding from his saddle to join him.

“Riders,” Gond breathed, barely a whisper. “East. Half a dozen, comin’ fast.”

The volunteers exchanged worried glances. They were still an hour from the farmstead, exposed on open ground with nowhere to hide except a thin line of scrub oak fifty yards to their left.

“Slavers?” Korven asked, his hand moving instinctively to his sword hilt.

Gond closed his eyes, extending his senses in ways he still didn’t fully understand. In his mind’s eye he saw the riders as shadowy figures, emanating menace. His senses screamed danger.

“Yes.” He opened his eyes, his decision made. “Into the trees. Now. Lead the horses.”

The volunteers moved with practiced efficiency, leading their mounts into the scrub oak and tying them deep in the shadows. Gond positioned his people in a rough line along the natural rise of the ridge, each hidden behind trunk or boulder. The terrain favored them here—the slavers would have to ride uphill through loose shale that would slow their horses and announce their approach. Weapons ready but orders clear—no one moved unless he gave the signal.

The sound of hoofbeats grew louder, accompanied by the jingle of mail and the creak of leather. Gond peered through the branches, counting the approaching riders. Six men in the colors of the Coastal Slavers Guild, their equipment professional and well-maintained. These weren’t the desperate bandits who sometimes raided isolated farms—these were soldiers.

“Thornfield’s picked clean, I tell ya,” one of the riders shouted over the wind. “Nothin’ but bones and ash there.”

“And you know this how, exactly?” an older, gravelly voice called back.

“Other farmstead told us\! Place’s been empty for months.” The younger man’s tone turned whiny. “C’mon, if we don’t get back to camp by dark, we’ll miss all the fun with those new farm-brats. That redhead…” He trailed off with a lewd chuckle.

“Fine, fine,” the older voice grumbled. “But if you’re wrong, it’s our hides the Captain will be tanning, not just yours.”

The chatter became indistinct as the party turned around and headed back.

Gond’s blood turned to ice. They were talking about systematically raiding farms, taking the farmers captive. It would only be a matter of time before they checked his valley.

The slavers continued past, their voices fading as they rode north toward destinations that made Gond’s stomach clench with dread. He waited until the sound of hooves disappeared entirely before signaling his people to emerge from hiding.

“Did you hear that?” Lira whispered, her face pale.

“Every word.” Gond’s jaw was set in grim lines. “Which means we need to move fast. Get what we can from Thornfield and get back to warn the others.”

They retrieved their horses and continued south, but the mood had changed. What had been a dangerous supply run was now a race against time. Every minute they spent away from the valley was another minute their families remained unaware of the approaching threat.

The Thornfield farmstead appeared through the evening mist like a ghost of better times. The main house stood intact but empty, its windows dark and door hanging open. Outbuildings clustered around it—barn, smokehouse, root cellar, grain storage. Exactly what they needed, if the slavers had left anything behind.

“Spread out,” Gond ordered quietly. “Check every building, but stay alert. If I give the signal, drop everything and run for the horses.”

The volunteers dispersed with purpose. Pell and Korven headed for the grain storage, while Lira led a team to the smokehouse. Gond made his way to the root cellar, hoping the slavers had overlooked the underground stores.

The heavy wooden door creaked as he lifted it, revealing stone steps descending into darkness. The air that rose from below was cool and dry—perfect for preservation. He descended carefully, his eyes adjusting to the gloom.

Barrels lined the walls, filled with salted pork, dried beans, preserved vegetables. Sacks of grain sat stacked in neat rows. The family had prepared well for winter, and the slavers had apparently been more interested in people than provisions.

“Gond\!” Pell’s voice carried from the grain storage. “You need to see this.”

He climbed from the cellar to find Pell standing beside the storage building, his expression a mixture of amazement and concern.

“They left *everything*,” Pell breathed, gesturing to the interior. “Wheat, barley, oats—Gods, Gond, there’s enough here to feed us for months\! But why? Slavers worth their salt strip a place bare.”

Gond grunted, kicking a stray sack. “You heard ’em. Lazy, sloppy. Raiders turned slavers, more than likely.”

“Load everything we can carry,” he ordered. “Fill every sack, every barrel we brought. But just in case they come back, don’t make it too obvious that we’ve been here. Keep the remaining supplies in neat stacks and leave no obvious signs.”

For the next two hours, the volunteers worked with desperate efficiency. They loaded grain sacks onto pack horses, filled water barrels with preserved meat, stuffed their saddlebags with dried vegetables and medicinal herbs from the farmhouse garden. Every pound they could carry was another day their community could survive.

As they prepared to depart, Gond took one last look at the abandoned farmstead. A family had lived here, worked this land, built their dreams in these buildings. Now it stood empty, another casualty in a war most people didn’t even know was being fought.

“Ready?” Pell asked, checking the straps on his heavily loaded pack horse.

Gond nodded, swinging into his saddle. “Let’s go home.”

They traveled a safe distance from the farmstead and then dozed, waiting for dawn. The return journey felt longer despite their urgency. The horses moved slowly under their heavy loads, and every sound made the volunteers reach for weapons. But Gond’s enhanced senses detected no immediate threats—the slavers had continued north, probably to regroup before their next assault.

They reached the valley as the sun touched the western peaks, their arrival greeted with cheers that quickly turned to concerned murmurs as word spread of what they’d overheard. Gond called an immediate gathering, the entire community clustering around the central fire as he shared the grim news.

“Slavers,” he said without preamble. “Systematically raiding and capturing all the residents in the area. We’ve got to assume they’ll be here in no more than a few weeks.”

The faces looking back at him showed fear, but also determination. These people had found hope in their hidden valley, and they wouldn’t surrender it without a fight.

“What do we do?” Sim asked quietly.

Gond looked around the circle of upturned faces—men and women who had trusted him with their lives, children who deserved a chance to grow up free. The weight of their faith settled on his shoulders like a mantle.

“Our time of quiet is over,” he announced, his voice flat but carrying. “Now we prepare for war.”

The words hit like stones dropped into still water, ripples of unease spreading through the crowd. But these were no longer the broken, desperate fugitives who had first stumbled into their sanctuary. Weeks of good food, safety, and purpose had transformed them into something resembling a community.

Korven, the surly man who had once challenged Lira over food, stepped forward. His tone held none of its former hostility. “What do you need us to do?”

Gond’s mind was already mapping their defensive strategy, seeing the flow of battle before it began. “Pell, take a team and set snares along the main approaches. Nothing lethal—we want to slow them down, not announce our presence with screams.”

He turned to Sim. “Organize the non-combatants. Evacuation routes, supply caches, places to hide the children.”

The priest nodded, already moving toward the families with young ones.

“The rest of you,” Gond continued, his voice carrying to every corner of the gathering, “we’re going to turn this valley into a fortress. Every advantage we can create, every trap we can set, every defensive position we can fortify—we use them all.”

The refugees dispersed with purpose, but Gond caught the overconfident glances some of the newcomers exchanged. They believed their remote valley made them untouchable. His instincts, sharper than ever, screamed otherwise.

Two weeks later, Gond crouched at the ridge’s edge, scanning the horizon for the expected raiders. He turned to Pell and Sim. “They’re coming soon.”

Pell frowned. “How can you be so certain?”

Gond couldn’t explain the certainty that gripped him, the way his skin seemed to prickle with awareness of distant threats. The sensation was like standing in an open field before a lightning strike—every nerve screaming of imminent danger.

“Call it intuition.”

“Your intuition’s been remarkably accurate lately,” Sim noted, joining their conversation. “Almost as if you’re receiving guidance from a higher source.”

“Don’t you start with that gods-talk now, Sim,” Gond grumbled, though there was no real bite to it. He was, slowly, starting to admit to himself that *something* was different, even if he’d rather face a dozen slavers than put a name to it.

A flicker of movement on the opposite ridge. “They’re here\!” His voice carried clearly through the morning air, but now it was a signal to his hidden watchers, not a call to battle. “About fifteen of them, approaching on foot\! Positions\!”

The refugees scattered in controlled chaos—some sprinting toward hidden weapon caches, others grabbing children and herding them toward the concealed cave entrances. Mothers clutched infants while older children helped carry supplies. Men stumbled over tent ropes in their haste to reach defensive positions, while women stuffed precious belongings into hastily packed bundles.

“Now,” Gond whispered, and melted into the forest like a ghost.

PART III  
*An Unlikely Saint*  
   
 

# **Chapter 11: First Blood, First Miracle**

The slave catchers’ confidence shattered like glass against stone. Gond’s ambush unfolded with devastating precision—bolts and arrows whistled from concealed positions, pit traps swallowed horses and riders, coordinated attacks turned the hunters into the hunted.  
Gond drew his sword and prepared to join the battle. The blade that emerged from its sheath was no longer the crude, dark iron he had carried for weeks. Instead, it gleamed like polished silver, its edge sharp as winter starlight.

“By the gods.” A nearby refugee lowered his bow, eyes wide. “Finally picked a weapon worthy of a leader.”

Gond flowed through the battle with fluid grace, his blade dancing between opponents while his feet found perfect footing on treacherous ground. Every decision flowed from instincts that seemed to see around corners. When the enemy tried to flank left, he was already there with a counter-ambush. When they attempted to retreat to higher ground, his archers were waiting. The flow of combat spread before him like a map, each move predictable, each counter-move inevitable.

Nearby, Korven fought with the methodical precision of his trade, his blacksmith’s hammer crushing armor and bone with equal efficiency. The big man had insisted on joining the ambush party, claiming his forge work had given him the strength to wield weapons others couldn’t lift. He proved his point by caving in a slaver’s breastplate with a single overhead blow, the bronze-reinforced steel crumpling like parchment.

“Behind you\!” Pell shouted, engaging two slavers near the valley’s entrance.

Gond spun, his blade meeting the descending sword of a massive slaver captain. The man’s strength was enormous, each blow driving Gond back step by step. Steel rang against steel as they fought, the captain’s experience evident in every calculated strike.

The slaver’s blade slipped past Gond’s guard, the point driving deep into his thigh. Fire shot up his leg, and he stumbled, blood flowing freely down to pool in his boot. The watching refugees gasped—such a wound would cripple a man, leave him limping for life if he survived at all.

But Gond fought on, his movements barely hindered. The transformed blade sang through the air with almost supernatural speed. When the captain raised his sword to block Gond’s next strike, the silver blade sheared through the steel like parchment, continuing its arc to find the gap between breastplate and helm. The man toppled backward, his severed weapon clattering in two pieces on the stone.

The battle turned decisively. The remaining slavers, seeing their leader fall and their ambush turned against them, broke and fled. Gond’s people pursued them to the valley’s edge before turning back whooping.

As the last echoes of combat faded, Pell approached Gond, his face chalk-white. “That wound—” He pointed at Gond’s leg, where blood had soaked through the fabric. “Gods, Gond, I saw that hells-damned blade go clean through\! You should be screaming, not standing\!”

Gond looked down, pulling aside the torn cloth. Where he expected to find a gaping wound, only a shallow graze marked his thigh. The bleeding had already stopped. He stared at the minor cut, his brow furrowing.

“I saw it\!” Pell shook his head, taking a step back. “That blade went deep. How are you even standing?”

The return to camp revealed a different horror. Overturned pots, scattered belongings, and drag marks in the dirt told the story. Two slavers had crept in during the battle, targeting those who couldn’t fight—the elderly, the women, the children. They had fled when they realized that their main force was broken.

But they had left their mark.

Old Henrik lay sprawled near the children’s shelter, his body riddled with crossbow bolts. The grizzled former soldier had died defending those he’d sworn to protect, his weathered hands still clutching the broken spear he’d used to hold the slavers at bay. Nearby, a young mother sat propped against a tree, her sightless eyes staring at nothing, blood still seeping from a gash in her chest. Gond recalled that she had just reached the refuge two days past.

Sim knelt beside the children’s shelter, cradling his right hand against his chest. His knuckles were split and bloody, and a slaver’s sword lay abandoned nearby, its wielder nowhere to be seen. When Gond approached, the priest looked up with pain-filled eyes.

“I had to,” Sim said quietly, his voice heavy with anguish. “He was going for the children. I couldn’t—” He swallowed hard, his eyes distant with old pain. “I struck his wrist. Just enough to make him drop the blade.” His shoulders sagged. “Every living being has the right to defend themselves and those who cannot defend themselves. But that doesn’t make it easier.” His voice dropped to barely a whisper. “It never gets easier.”

And in the center of the camp, young Dax lay gasping in a spreading pool of his own blood.

The boy’s chest rose and fell in ragged, desperate rhythm. Pink froth bubbled from his lips with each labored breath. A slaver’s mace had crushed his ribs, driving bone fragments deep into his lungs. Each breath was a struggle, each heartbeat weaker than the last.

Sim moved from the children’s shelter to kneel beside Dax, ignoring the pain in his injured hand as he channeled what healing power he possessed. Sweat beaded on the priest’s forehead, his face growing ashen with effort. His hands trembled, the light flickering like a dying candle.

“He’s gone,” Sim choked out, tears blurring his vision. “Alanyi forgive me, the damage… it’s too much. I can’t… I can’t do it.” His hands fell to his sides, the faint glow extinguished.

Around them, the survivors gathered in a silent circle. Shoulders slumped in defeat. Hands covered mouths to stifle sobs. Eyes turned away from the dying boy, unable to bear witness to their helplessness. Alia knelt beside her brother, her tears falling onto his blood-stained face.

Gond felt a pull he could neither name nor resist. His feet carried him forward without conscious thought, drawn by an invisible thread that seemed to connect his heart to the dying boy. The circle of mourners parted before him, their faces etched with resignation.

He knelt beside Dax, his hands hovering over the terrible wounds. The boy’s breathing grew shallower, more labored. Time was running out.

Alia looked up, her face streaked with tears. She reached out as if to stop him.

“Let him work,” Sim said quietly, catching her wrist. His eyes never left Gond’s face.

Gond placed his palms on Dax’s chest and closed his eyes. At first, nothing. No warmth, no power, no divine presence. Just the sticky wetness of blood and the broken rhythm of a failing heart beneath his hands.

*Alanyi,* he prayed silently, the words forming without conscious thought. *If you’re there, if this is real, help me save him.*

Gradually, like the first star appearing in the night sky, he became aware of a presence. A flicker of life, faint as a dying ember. Dax’s essence, barely clinging to the broken shell of his body, ready to slip away into darkness.

Gond cupped that fragile spark in his mind, breathing on it as one might coax life from the last coal in a cold hearth. He imagined the boy whole—ribs unbroken, lungs clear, blood flowing as it should. He poured his will into that vision, feeding the ember with everything he had.

The spark flared. Grew. Blazed into brilliant flame.

Suddenly, Dax’s life force erupted like a wildfire, burning so bright it drove Gond’s awareness back, overwhelming his senses with its intensity. Golden light poured from his hands, illuminating the entire camp with radiance that outshone the afternoon sun.

The boy’s wounds began to close. Bones knitted together with audible clicks. Torn flesh mended itself. The blood that had pooled beneath him seemed to flow backward, returning to his body as if time itself were reversing.

Heat flooded through Gond’s arms, as if molten gold flowed through his veins instead of blood. His palms burned where they touched the boy’s chest, not with pain but with an intensity that made his bones ache. The power coursed through him like lightning, leaving his muscles trembling and his breath coming in sharp gasps.

Gond’s vision went white. The blazing essence pushed him out, severing his connection to the healing. He swayed, his hands falling away from Dax’s chest as consciousness returned in fragments. His fingertips still tingled with residual warmth, and the taste of copper and starlight lingered on his tongue.

When his sight cleared, Dax was sitting up, his hand moving to where the fatal wounds had been. Nothing remained but unmarked skin. His eyes were clear and bright, no trace of pain or injury marring his young face.

Not a breath stirred the air. Even the wind had stilled, as if nature itself held its breath. The crackling of dying embers from overturned cook fires seemed thunderous in the absolute quiet. Fifty refugees stared at Gond with expressions that ranged from awe to fear to something approaching worship. The golden light faded, leaving only the ordinary afternoon sun, but its memory blazed in every watching eye.

“Alanyi’s mercy,” someone whispered from the back of the crowd.

“A miracle,” breathed another, falling to his knees.

An older woman formed her fingers into the intertwined circles of Alanyi repeatedly, her lips moving in silent prayer. A young father clutched his children closer, his eyes wide with wonder and fear. Several refugees stepped backward, as if afraid to stand too close to such divine power, while others pressed forward, reaching out with trembling hands as if to touch the lingering traces of holy light.

Gond staggered backward, his legs giving out beneath him. He sat heavily on the ground, staring at his hands as they trembled with residual power. There was no denying it now, no rationalizing it away. The force that had flowed through him was divine, unmistakable in its nature and scope.

Sim approached slowly, his face radiant. “Now do you believe?” he asked gently.

Gond looked at his hands, still tingling with the memory of that blazing light. He thought of the temple, the vision, the voice that had spoken of carrying hope. All the signs had been there, but he had refused to see them for what they were.

“I believe,” he breathed, the admission a weight off his soul. Then, a rougher prayer, almost a curse: “I believe, Alanyi help me.”

The priest smiled, placing a hand on Gond’s shoulder. “She already has, my friend. She already has.”

As word of the miracle spread through the camp, Gond found himself surrounded by refugees seeking his blessing, his touch, his guidance. They knelt before him, reached out to brush his robes, whispered prayers in his name. The reluctant mercenary was gone, replaced by something he had never wanted to become but could no longer deny.

Dax stood and walked to him, his young face solemn with understanding beyond his years. “Thank you,” he said simply, then knelt and kissed Gond’s hand.

The gesture broke something inside Gond’s chest. He pulled the boy to his feet, then looked out over the faces of his people—for they were his people now, bound to him by faith and miracle and the golden light that had flowed from his hands.

He was a paladin of Alanyi, chosen and blessed, whether he liked it or not.

Around him, the refugees began to sing—a hymn of praise that rose to the heavens, carrying with it the hope of the oppressed and the promise of justice to come. Gond stood among them, no longer fighting his destiny but embracing it, ready to carry the burden and the blessing of divine purpose.

   
 

# **Chapter 12: Paladin’s Rise**

A month had passed since the golden light, and Gond still couldn’t walk through the settlement without notice. Heads turned as he passed. Conversations paused mid-word. Children peered from behind their mothers’ skirts, wide-eyed and whispering.  
The valley had changed in those weeks. What had begun as a desperate refuge for escaped slaves had grown into something resembling a proper community. Where once there had been only crude lean-tos, now sturdy cabins with stone foundations lined the hillsides. Marta’s vegetable garden had expanded into terraced plots where beans climbed wooden stakes and squash vines sprawled between rows of grain. The sound of Jorik’s hammer rang from dawn to dusk at his new forge, where he’d transformed salvaged chain links into horseshoes and broken sword blades into farming tools.

But the most significant change was in how people looked at Gond.

They no longer simply waited for his orders—they sought his blessing. Mothers brought sick children to him. Hunters asked him to consecrate their weapons. Even mundane disputes were brought before him, as if his touch with the divine granted him wisdom in all matters.

Gond hated it.

“You can’t keep avoiding them,” Pell said, settling beside him on the rocky outcrop where Gond had taken to eating his morning meal. Below them, the settlement bustled with activity, but Gond could see several people glancing up toward his retreat.

“I’m not avoiding them. I’m eating breakfast.”

“Up here. Alone. For the third day running.” Pell bit into a piece of dried meat. “They think you’re angry with them.”

“I’m not angry.” Gond stabbed at his porridge with unnecessary force. “I’m just… tired of being treated like some kind of saint.”

“You did bring a boy back from the dead.”

“I healed him. There’s a difference.”

Pell raised an eyebrow. “Is there? Because from where I was standing, Dax was gone. No breath, no heartbeat, blood everywhere. Then you touched him and he sat up like he’d been taking a nap.”

Gond set down his bowl, appetite gone. The memory of that moment still haunted him—the absolute certainty that the boy was beyond help, followed by the impossible surge of power that had proven him wrong. He’d performed smaller healings since then, mending cuts and curing fevers, but nothing approaching that first miracle.

“The power isn’t always there,” he said quietly. “Sometimes I reach for it and find nothing. What happens when someone really needs help and I can’t—”

“Then you do what you can with your hands and your sword, same as always.” Pell’s voice was matter-of-fact. “But that doesn’t mean you should hide from the gift when it’s there.”

Before Gond could respond, Sim appeared at the top of the path, slightly out of breath from the climb. “Gond, you need to come down. There’s someone here to see you.”

“Another sick child?”

“No.” Sim’s expression was strange—part wonder, part uncertainty. “An elf. She says she’s been traveling for weeks, drawn here by—by Alanyi’s call.”

Gond and Pell exchanged glances. Elves were legends in these parts, creatures of story and song who kept to their hidden forests. What would bring one here?

They made their way down the winding path to the settlement’s heart, where a crowd had gathered in a respectful circle around the newcomer. Gond could see her through the gaps between bodies—tall and graceful, with silver hair that caught the morning light and clothes that seemed to shimmer with their own inner radiance.

The crowd parted as Gond approached, and he got his first clear look at her. She was beautiful in the way of growing things—ageless and serene, with eyes the color of deep forest pools. But there was something else in those eyes, a weight of years and knowledge that made Gond feel suddenly young and foolish.

Silviana’s gaze lingered on his fading brand, her head tilting as her fingers traced patterns in the air, following the outline of where the twin manacles had once burned so clearly. The marks were still visible, but faded now—more shadow than scar, as if the mark of his bondage was being erased. When she spoke, her voice carried the music of wind through leaves, each word flowing like water over stones.

“You are the one they call the Healer of the Hills.”

It wasn’t a question. Gond nodded anyway, acutely aware of the watching crowd. “I’m Gond. And you are?”

“Silviana Starweaver, Lore-keeper of the Moonwood Circle.” She inclined her head slightly. “I have traveled far to find you, drawn by a calling I have not felt in many decades.”

“What kind of calling?”

Silviana stepped closer with the fluid grace of wind through branches, and Gond caught the scent of pine and lavender that seemed to cling to her. “The touch of Alanyi. Her power flows through this place like a river, and you…” She reached out as if to touch his face, her movements deliberate and unhurried, then stopped, her hand hovering inches from his skin. “You are the source. I sense great gifts growing in you—some already awakened, others still sleeping, waiting for their time.”

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Gond felt heat rise in his cheeks, uncomfortable with the scrutiny. “I don’t know about gifts. I just do what I can to help.”

“Modesty.” Silviana’s lips curved in a slight smile. “That is good. The goddess has little use for the proud.” She lowered her hand. “But false modesty serves no one. You have been chosen, Gond of the Branded Brow. The question is whether you will accept what you have become.”

“And what’s that?”

“A paladin of Alanyi. Her champion in a world that has forgotten her light.”

The words hit the crowd like a rock in a pond. Some gasped, others fell to their knees. Gond heard someone whisper a prayer, another person sob with what sounded like relief.

“Forgotten her light?” Gond asked. “What do you mean?”

The corners of Silviana’s mouth drew down, fine lines deepening around her ancient eyes. “The goddess of mercy has been pushed aside by those who profit from suffering. Where once her temples offered sanctuary, now the priests of Kemiss—god of commerce—hold sway, blessing slavers’ chains and counting coin from slave auctions. And darker still…” She paused, glancing around at the listening crowd. “There are whispers of banned worship returning, evil cloaked in false righteousness.”

“I’m not a paladin,” Gond said, his voice rougher than intended. “I’ve got some healing abilities, maybe even from Alanyi, but it’s a gift that others have as well. Sim here also has the power of healing.”

Silviana’s expression grew gentle but firm. “A mere healer does wield such power that it can be sensed leagues away, Gond. A mere healer does not call an elf from her forest home after a century of silence. A mere healer does not gather the lost and broken and forge them into something stronger.” She gestured toward the settlement around them. “Look at what you have built here. Look at what you have become.”

Gond followed her gaze, seeing the community through her eyes. The former slaves who now stood tall and proud. The children who played without fear. The gardens and workshops and homes that had grown from nothing but hope and determination.

“I can’t be a paladin,” Gond said. “That would mean—”

“It would mean you have a lot of work ahead of you,” said Silviani, eyes glinting humorously.

“Look around at these people,” she continued. “They followed where you led. They trusted where you guided. They believed because you gave them reason to believe.” Silviana’s voice carried absolute certainty. “That is what paladins do, Gond. They kindle hope in the hopeless. They stand as light against the darkness.”

Sim stepped forward, his face bright. “Accept it, Gond. We all can see it.”

Gond looked at his friend, then at the elf, then at the faces surrounding them. All waiting for his response. All hoping he would accept what they already believed.

The weight of their expectation pressed down on him like a physical thing. Part of him wanted to deny it, to insist he was just a man with a useful talent. But another part—a part that had been growing stronger since that first night in the ruined temple—recognized the truth in Silviana’s words.

“All right,” he said finally. “Say I accept it. Say I am what you think I am. What then?”

“Then you learn,” Silviana said. “You grow into your power, and your power grows with you. You discover what it truly means to serve the goddess of peace and mercy.”

She gestured toward his fading brand. “Already the goddess works to free you from the marks of bondage. As your connection to Alanyi deepens, her light will erase all traces of your enslavement. And in time…” Her voice grew soft with wonder. “In time, you will carry that same gift to others. The touch that heals wounds can also heal the scars of slavery itself.”

“You mean I could remove their brands?” Gond asked, thinking of the marked faces throughout the settlement.

“More than remove—erase completely, as if they had never been. It is one of the greatest gifts a paladin of mercy can offer: the chance to be truly free, unmarked by past suffering.”

“And after that?”

The elf’s expression grew somber. “After that, you face the trials that await all who carry Alanyi’s light. The darkness has grown strong in her absence, Gond. It will not suffer a new paladin to rise unopposed.”

Gond nodded slowly, feeling something settle into place inside his chest—not resignation, but acceptance. The reluctant mercenary was gone, burned away in golden fire and weeks of gradual understanding. In his place stood something new, something he was still learning to be.

“Then teach me,” he said. “Both of you. Help me understand what I’ve become.”

Silviana smiled, and for the first time it reached her ancient eyes. “The first lesson begins now. Come—there is much to discuss, and the day grows short.”

As they walked toward Gond’s shelter, Silviana’s gaze fell upon the sword at Gond’s side. Her steps slowed, and she tilted her head as if listening to something only she could hear.

“Your blade,” she said quietly. “May I see it?”

Gond hesitated, then drew the silver sword. Even in the afternoon light, it seemed to gleam with its own inner radiance, the steel unmarked despite use in hard fighting. The moment the blade cleared its sheath, a subtle hum could be heard, nearly beyond the range of human hearing.

Silviana’s eyes widened with recognition, her breath catching as she stared at the blue-silver steel. “By the ancient trees,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I had heard rumors, but to see it with my own eyes…” She looked up at Gond with something approaching reverence, her hands trembling slightly. “Do you know what you carry?”

“A sword that used to be crude iron,” Gond said. “It changed during my travels.”

“Not just any sword—a blade touched by divine will.” Silviana’s voice carried the weight of ancient knowledge. “The old songs speak of such weapons—steel transformed by righteous purpose, forged not in earthly fires but in the crucible of a paladin’s awakening. There have been perhaps a dozen such blades in all the long years since Alanyi first walked among mortals.”

Sim moved closer, his eyes bright with wonder. “The legends are true, then? About paladin weapons?”

“More than true. They are living things, in their way—extensions of the divine will that flows through their bearers.” Silviana gestured toward the blade. “That steel will never dull, never break, never fail you in righteous battle. It will grow in power as you grow, becoming more than mere metal as your connection to Alanyi deepens.”

Gond stared at the sword, remembering the moment it had sheared through the slaver captain’s weapon like parchment. “It cut through steel during the battle.”

“And it will do far more than that, in time.” Silviana’s expression grew distant, remembering. “The last such blade I saw was carried by Ser Aldric the Pure, three centuries past. His sword could cleave through enchanted armor as if it were silk, and its light could banish shadows that had never known the sun.”

“What happened to him?” Gond asked.

“He fell defending a village from a demon incursion, his blade blazing like a star until the very end.” Silviana’s voice was soft with old grief. “His sword dissolved into mist upon his death, for the blade had become an extension of his soul.”

Gond sheathed the weapon carefully, feeling its weight differently now. Not just steel and leather, but a sign of his calling.

As they walked toward Gond’s shelter, the crowd began to disperse, but Gond could feel their eyes following him. The weight of their hope, their faith, their need. It no longer felt quite so crushing. Instead, it felt like purpose.

Behind them, Sim fell into step with a spring in his stride that hadn’t been there in weeks. “A paladin,” he murmured, just loud enough for Gond to hear. “Alanyi be praised, I knew it from the start.”

“Don’t get smug about it,” Gond said, but there was no real irritation in his voice.

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Sim replied, grinning.

Silviana glanced between them, her expression amused. “I see you have already learned one of the most important lessons of being a paladin.”

“Which is?”

“That even the chosen need friends.”

Despite everything—the weight of destiny, the burden of power, the uncertainty of what lay ahead—Gond found himself smiling.

   
 

# **Chapter 13: Healing Hands, Troubled Heart**

The morning sun filtered through the valley’s canopy, casting dappled shadows across the clearing where Gond sat cross-legged on a flat stone. His hands rested palm-up on his knees, fingers slightly curled as Silviana had shown him. The position felt ridiculous—like a street performer waiting for coins. His left foot had gone numb twenty minutes ago, and a persistent ache was building between his shoulder blades from holding his spine so rigidly straight.  
“Breathe,” Silviana said from her place on the moss-covered log beside him. “Feel the light within you, not as a foreign thing, but as part of your very essence.”

Gond’s jaw tightened. “I feel like an idiot.”

“That is progress.” Her voice carried the hint of a smile. “Yesterday you felt like a fraud.”

Three weeks had passed since the elven lore-keeper’s arrival. Three weeks of what she called “divine education” and what he called “sitting around pretending to be mystical.” The settlement had grown accustomed to seeing them together each dawn—the gruff former mercenary and the ageless elf, an unlikely pair of teacher and student.

“Close your eyes,” Silviana instructed. “Reach for the warmth you felt when you healed Dax.”

Gond obeyed, though his shoulders remained rigid. The memory came easily enough—the desperate pull in his chest, the sensation of something flowing out of him and into the dying young man. But trying to summon that feeling deliberately was like grasping smoke.

“I can’t—” he began.

“You are trying to command it,” Silviana interrupted. “Divine power is not a sword to be wielded. It is a river to be channeled.”

“Rivers can be dammed.”

“And what happens to a river when it is dammed?”

Gond opened his eyes to find her watching him with those ancient, knowing eyes. “It finds another way through. Or it builds pressure until it breaks free.”

“Precisely.” She gestured toward the settlement below, where smoke rose from cooking fires and the sounds of daily life drifted upward. “Your power has been finding its own way through—in moments of crisis, when your conscious mind steps aside.”

The strain. Gond’s hand moved unconsciously to his chest, where a persistent ache had settled after each healing. Not pain exactly, but a tension, as if he were forcing divine energy through channels too narrow to contain it properly. After healing Dax, he’d slept for nearly two days. The smaller healings since—a child’s fever, an infected wound, a broken bone—left him exhausted for hours.

“The exhaustion will lessen,” Silviana said, reading his thoughts with unsettling accuracy. “As you learn to open yourself properly to the divine flow rather than fighting against it.”

A commotion from below interrupted their session. Voices raised in argument, the sound of running feet. Gond was on his feet before he’d consciously decided to move. His hand reached for the sword that wasn’t there—he’d left his weapons in his hut, as Silviana insisted during their morning sessions.

“Gond\!” Pell’s voice carried up the slope, sharp with urgency. “We need you\!”

The thief appeared through the trees, his usually composed face tight with worry. Behind him came Sim, supporting a woman Gond didn’t recognize—middle-aged, her clothes torn and bloodied, her left arm hanging at an unnatural angle.

“Found her at the valley’s edge,” Pell said without preamble. “Says she’s been walking for days, following rumors of a healer.”

The woman raised her head. Gond saw the desperation in her eyes—the same look he’d seen in every refugee who’d found their way here. But this was different. Worse. Her skin had a grayish pallor. When she tried to speak, blood flecked her lips.

“Internal injuries,” Sim said quietly. “Beyond my skills.”

Heat bloomed beneath Gond’s ribs, spreading outward like spilled wine through fabric. His fingertips tingled with an electric warmth that made his hands tremble slightly. But this time, instead of letting it flow unchecked, he tried to apply Silviana’s teachings. He closed his eyes briefly, reaching for that sense of channeling rather than commanding.

“Bring her to the healing circle,” he said, his voice steadier than he felt.

They’d established the healing circle at Silviana’s suggestion—a ring of smooth stones in a grove where the light fell just so, where the very air seemed to hum with potential. As they laid the woman on the soft grass within the circle, Gond knelt beside her and placed his hands gently on her shoulders.

“What’s your name?” he asked.

“Mira,” she whispered. “My… my village. They came in the night. Slavers. I hid in the root cellar, but when I tried to help the others…” She coughed, more blood staining her lips.

Gond felt the rage building—the old, familiar fury at the injustice of it all. But beneath that anger, something else stirred. The divine light, responding not to his commands but to his compassion. He let himself feel Mira’s pain, her terror, her desperate hope.

The power flowed through him like warm honey, slower and more controlled than before. He felt it seeking out the damaged places within her—the internal bleeding, the shattered ribs, the trauma that went deeper than flesh. Through his palms, he sensed torn vessels sealing themselves, felt the grinding sensation of bone fragments drawing together and fusing. Her labored breathing eased as punctured lung tissue mended, and the gray pallor of her skin gradually warmed to healthy pink. But as the healing progressed, Gond became aware of something else: the effort of proper channeling.

The world blazed white around him. That same overwhelming pulse of divine essence he’d felt with Dax, but more focused now. More controlled. The connection formed between divine will and mortal need, a bridge of golden light that let him channel Alanyi’s grace into her broken body. Each mended bone required deeper concentration. Each sealed wound demanded greater spiritual focus.

The divine power flowed endlessly from its source—but his capacity to channel it had limits. The realization should have frightened him, but instead it brought clarity. This was the true challenge of his calling: not just the responsibility of choice, but learning to be a worthy vessel for divine grace.

When the healing was complete, Mira sat up slowly, her color restored, her breathing clear. She stared at her mended arm in wonder, flexing fingers that had been broken moments before.

“How?” she breathed.

Gond swayed slightly as he stood. Silviana’s steadying hand touched his elbow. “Rest here tonight,” he told Mira. “Sim will see that you’re fed and given clean clothes. Tomorrow, if you choose to stay, we’ll find you a place among us.”

As they helped Mira to one of the guest shelters, Gond caught Silviana’s eye. The elf nodded approvingly, but her expression remained serious.

“You felt it,” she said once they were alone again. “The true effort.”

“The strain,” Gond said, settling heavily onto a fallen log. “The healing you showed me demands more focus, more spiritual discipline.”

“Precisely,” Silviana corrected. “The divine power does not diminish—it flows endlessly from its source. But your capacity to channel it safely grows only through practice and spiritual development.”

Gond considered this as he watched the settlement below. More people had arrived in recent days—word of the “healer in the hills” spreading despite their efforts at secrecy. Each new face brought hope and desperation in equal measure. Each represented another choice, another burden.

“What if I lack the strength to channel the power? I don’t know if I could repeat that healing if another injured person appeared now.”

“Alanyi will never ask you to give more than you can,” said Silviana.

Gond thought that could be taken in more than one way, but said nothing.

But even as Silviana spoke, Gond knew he wouldn’t refuse. Couldn’t refuse. Not when faces like Mira’s looked to him with such desperate hope. The choice had been made the moment he’d first felt the divine light stir within him—perhaps even before that, in the slave ship’s hold when he’d chosen to help others escape rather than flee alone.

“The exhaustion will pass,” Silviana continued. “Your body will adapt, learn to channel the power more efficiently. But the weight of choice—that will remain.”

As if summoned by her words, another commotion arose from the settlement’s edge. More voices, more urgent calls for the healer. Gond closed his eyes and felt the divine power stirring again, ready to answer the call.

“How do you bear it?” he asked. “Knowing that every choice to heal one person might mean being too weak to heal the next?”

Silviana was quiet for a long moment, her gaze distant. “You learn to trust,” she said finally. “Trust that the divine light knows its own purpose, even when you cannot see it. Trust that each healing, each choice, serves a greater pattern.”

Another call echoed up from below—Pell’s voice again, urgent but not panicked. Gond pushed himself to his feet, his legs unsteady beneath him. His hands shook slightly as he brushed dirt from his knees, and he had to pause a moment to let a wave of dizziness pass. The ache in his chest had deepened, but beneath it, he felt something else: a strange sense of rightness, as if he were finally walking a path meant for him.

“Come,” Silviana said, rising gracefully beside him. “Let us see what new challenge awaits.”

As they made their way down the slope, Gond reflected on the morning’s lesson. He was beginning to understand that divine power wasn’t something he possessed—it was something that possessed him, flowed through him, changed him with each use. The thought should have terrified him, but instead it brought an odd sort of peace.

He was no longer the man who’d awakened in chains, driven by thoughts of revenge. That man had died somewhere between the slave ship and this valley, replaced by someone he was still learning to recognize. Someone who chose to heal rather than harm, to protect rather than pursue vengeance.

The irony wasn’t lost on him. In losing his old self, he’d found something far more valuable—a purpose that went beyond personal satisfaction or gain. It was a burden, yes, but it was also a gift.

The afternoon brought three more refugees: a family fleeing burned farmlands, their youngest child burning with fever. Gond healed the boy, then spent an hour teaching the parents how to recognize the signs of infection. By evening, Gorn was so exhausted from channeling that he felt hollow inside. Still, the child’s laughter as he played with the other settlement children made the cost seem worthwhile.

As darkness fell and the settlement settled into its nightly routines, Gond found himself sitting by the central fire, staring into the flames. Silviana approached with two cups of the herbal tea she favored—something that tasted of mint and sage.

“The hardest lesson,” she said, settling beside him, “is learning when not to heal.”

Gond accepted the cup gratefully, letting its warmth seep into his hands. “Meaning?”

“A paladin’s capacity to channel divine power has limits, even as the power itself flows endlessly. Exhaust yourself on minor ailments, and you may lack the spiritual strength when true crisis strikes. The power to heal is also affected by the strength of the conduit-your own power as a paladin, but the patient’s connection to Alanyi also anchors the connection, helps the power flow. You must take all of this into account when deciding who to heal.”

The weight of her words settled over him like a heavy cloak. “So I’m supposed to choose who deserves healing and who doesn’t?”

“You are supposed to choose wisely. To see the larger pattern, the greater need.” Silviana sipped her tea, her expression thoughtful. “Sometimes Alanyi herself may guide your choices—instructing you to heal fully, or merely to ease suffering. Above all else, you must strive to obey the will of Alanyi when you would channel her divine power.”

“And how am I supposed to know the will of Alanyi? I’ve never heard her voice since that first time in the temple.”

“Trust me,” said Siliviana with a smile. “When the goddess speaks to you, you’ll know it.”

Gond drank his tea in silence, watching the flames dance and shift. Around them, the settlement hummed with quiet activity—families sharing evening meals, guards taking their posts, the soft murmur of conversation and laughter. All of it made possible by his choice to heal rather than flee, to build rather than destroy.

“The boy today,” he said finally. “His fever—it wasn’t life-threatening, was it?”

“Probably not. Sim’s herbs would have broken it in a day or two.”

“But his parents’ faces when I healed him instantly…”

“Hope,” Silviana finished. “You gave them hope. And hope, properly nurtured, can be more powerful than any sword.”

Gond nodded slowly, beginning to understand. Each healing was more than just the mending of flesh—it was a statement, a promise, a beacon for others to follow. The divine power flowing through him wasn’t just about individual miracles, but about building something larger.

The thought should have daunted him, but instead it filled him with a strange sense of anticipation. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new choices, new opportunities to channel the divine light in service of something greater than himself.

   
 

# **Chapter 14: The Legend Begins**

Gond stood at the settlement’s edge, watching the plume of black from the nearest farmstead with unease. Scouts had seen the rows of black smoke marking the slavers’ approach two days prior. Beside him, Pell squinted against the morning light, his hand resting on his knife hilt.  
The settlement had grown considerably in the weeks since Silviana’s arrival. The population had swelled to nearly two hundred souls, all drawn by whispered tales of the “Healer in the Hills.”

And that, Gond reflected grimly, was precisely the problem.

“How many new refugees are we getting these days?” he asked.

Pell consulted the tally marks carved into a piece of bark—his method for tracking new arrivals. “Three yesterday. Seven the day before. Word’s spreading faster than we can contain it.”

The numbers told the story Gond had been dreading. Each healing, each miracle, sent ripples outward through the network of desperate people seeking hope. Refugees told other refugees. Escaped slaves whispered to those still in bondage. Sympathetic villagers passed along rumors to anyone who would listen.

The “Healer in the Hills” was becoming a legend, and legends, Gond had learned, were dangerous things.

“Gond\!” Sim’s voice carried across the settlement, urgent but controlled. The priest emerged from between two shelters, supporting an elderly man whose clothes marked him as a city dweller—fine fabric, now torn and stained from hard travel.

“Another one?” Pell muttered.

As they approached, Gond could see the man’s condition—exhaustion, dehydration, and something else. The hollow look of someone who’d lost everything and was clinging to a final thread of hope.

“This is Marcus,” Sim said as they reached the group. “He’s traveled from Westport. Three weeks on foot.”

Westport. Gond’s jaw tightened. That was nearly a hundred miles southeast—farther than any previous refugee had traveled to reach them. The implications were troubling.

Marcus raised his head, and Gond saw tears cutting tracks through the grime on his cheeks. His hands shook as he spoke, and Gond noticed the raw blisters on his palms from weeks of walking with an improvised staff. “My granddaughter,” he whispered, his voice cracking with exhaustion. “The wasting sickness. The healers in Westport… they said there was nothing—but I heard stories. A man who could work miracles. Please, I have gold—”

“Keep your gold,” Gond said gently, helping Sim support the old man. “Where is she?”

“I… I couldn’t bring her. Too weak for the journey. She’s with my daughter in Westport, but—” Marcus’s voice broke. “She won’t last much longer. Please, if you could come—”

“I can’t leave the valley,” Gond said, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. “We’re liable to be attacked—”

“Then she’ll die.” Marcus’s grip on Gond’s arm was surprisingly strong. “A child of eight years, and she’ll die because I couldn’t convince a miracle worker to travel a few days’ ride.”

The accusation hit harder than any physical blow. Gond felt the familiar stirring of divine power, responding to the old man’s anguish, but also something else—a growing weight of impossible expectations. How many Marcus’s were there? How many desperate souls making impossible journeys based on impossible hopes?

“Sim,” he said quietly. “Take Marcus to the guest area. Food, water, rest. We’ll talk more when he’s recovered from his journey.”

As the priest led the old man away, Gond remained standing at the settlement’s edge, staring at that distant smoke. The weight of too many choices, too many needs, pressed down on his shoulders like a physical burden.

“You can’t save them all,” Pell said quietly.

“I know that.” The words came out sharper than Gond intended. “But knowing it and living with it are different things.”

They stood in silence for a moment, watching the settlement come alive around them. Children played between the shelters—some born here, others rescued from various horrors. Adults went about the business of daily survival with the quiet efficiency of people who’d learned to make the most of what they had. Guards took their positions at the valley’s approaches, weapons ready but faces relaxed.

It was, Gond realized, starting to feel like home. And that made what was coming all the more painful.

“Won’t be much longer until the slavers reach the valley,” he said.

Pell nodded. “That burning farmstead is no more than an hour away on horseback.”

“It’s only a matter of time.” Gond’s hand moved to his sword hilt. “Question is, how long do we have?”

The answer came sooner than expected. A shout from the eastern watch post echoed across the valley, followed by the sound of a horn—three short blasts, the signal for approaching strangers. Not the long, urgent call that would indicate immediate danger, but enough to put everyone on alert.

Gond and Pell jogged toward the watch post, arriving just as the sentry pointed toward a group of figures emerging from the tree line. A dozen people, moving slowly, supporting each other. Refugees, by the look of them, but something was wrong. They moved with the desperate urgency of people fleeing immediate danger.

“Slavers,” the lead figure gasped as they reached the settlement’s edge. A woman, middle-aged, her clothes singed and torn. “Burned out Millhaven village. Took everyone they could catch. We ran… been running for two days…”

“How many slavers?” Pell asked, already thinking tactically.

“Fifty, maybe more. Professional outfit, not the usual raiders. They had a list.” The woman’s eyes found Gond, and he saw recognition dawn in them. “They were asking about the healer. They’re moving fast, like they know exactly where they’re going.”

The words hit the settlement like a physical blow. Conversations stopped. Children moved closer to their parents. Hands drifted toward weapons.

“They know,” someone whispered.

“We’re trapped,” another voice added.

“Quiet,” Gond said, his voice carrying across the suddenly tense crowd. “Everyone stay calm. We’ve prepared for this.”

But even as he spoke the words, Gond felt the weight of leadership settling heavier on his shoulders. With nearly two hundred souls in the valley, including children and elderly, defense would be a desperate affair. They had to rely on the courage of their few fighters and the strength of their defensive positions.

“Pell,” he said quietly. “How long to get out those who can’t fight?”

“If we start now? Six hours, minimum. And that’s if we leave everything behind.”

Six hours. Gond looked at the smoke on the horizon, estimating distances and travel times. He reckoned they had two hours at most. And if they knew about the valley beforehand…

“They’ll be here by midday,” he said.

“Maybe sooner,” Pell agreed grimly.

The crowd was looking to him now, waiting for orders, for reassurance, for another miracle. But this wasn’t something divine power could solve. This was tactics, logistics, and hard choices.

“Pell, get the fighters to their posts. Those who can’t fight, behind the pallisade.” Gond wasn’t about to leave the non-fighters undefended again.

The settlement exploded into controlled chaos as people scattered to follow his orders. But Gond remained standing in the center of it all, feeling strangely detached from the urgency around him. This was what he’d feared from the beginning—the moment when his presence would bring danger to those he’d sworn to protect.

“Second thoughts?” Pell asked, appearing at his elbow.

“About what?”

“All of this. The healing, the settlement, playing savior to every lost soul who wanders into our valley.” The thief’s voice was carefully neutral, but Gond caught the underlying question.

“You think I should have stayed focused on Borin and Kael.”

“I think,” Pell said slowly, “that a few months ago, you would have been halfway to wherever they’re hiding by now. Instead, you’re here, about to risk your life for a bunch of strangers.” His voice carried something Gond had never heard before—not just respect, but something deeper. “I’ve worked for a lot of men who called themselves leaders. Most of them only cared about what their followers could do for them.”

The observation hit Gond like a revelation. When had he last thought about his former comrades? When had the burning need for revenge faded into something so distant it felt like someone else’s memory?

“When did it happen?” he asked, more to himself than to Pell.

“When did what happen?”

“When did I stop caring about revenge?”

Pell was quiet for a moment, watching the evacuation preparations with thoughtful eyes. “Hard to say exactly. Maybe when you chose to leave Blackwater and lead us to this valley. Maybe when you started healing people instead of planning how to hurt the ones who wronged you.” He shrugged. “Or maybe it was gradual—so slow you didn’t notice until now.”

Gond felt something shift inside him, like a weight he’d been carrying for so long he’d forgotten it was there suddenly lifting away. The rage that had sustained him through slavery, through escape, through those first desperate weeks of freedom—it was gone. Not suppressed or controlled, but genuinely absent, replaced by something else entirely.

“I don’t want revenge anymore,” he said, the words feeling strange on his tongue.

“I know,” Pell said simply. His eyes held a glint of something that might have been satisfaction. “First time I’ve followed someone who actually gives a damn about the people under his command. Makes a difference.” He paused, then added quietly, “Question is, what do you want instead?”

Before Gond could answer, another commotion arose from the settlement’s edge. More refugees, these ones in even worse condition than the last group. And behind them, barely visible through the trees, the glint of metal in the morning sun.

“They’re here,” someone shouted.

The preparations, barely begun, ground to a halt. Children began crying. Adults froze in terror, looking around desperately for somewhere to run.

But there was nowhere to run. The valley had only two exits—the main approach where the slavers were advancing, and a narrow mountain pass that would take hours to traverse with so many people. They were trapped.

Gond felt the divine power stirring within him, responding to the fear and desperation around him. But this wasn’t a situation that could be healed or blessed away. This required a different kind of intervention.

“Are the fighters ready?” asked Gond.

“Ready? Sure,” said Pell. “But we’ve got maybe thirty who know which end of a sword to hold. Another twenty with hunting experience.” Pell’s expression was grim. “Against fifty professional slavers? I give us an hour.”

Gond looked around at the faces turned toward him—people who’d come here seeking safety, seeking healing, seeking hope. People who trusted him to protect them.

The weight of that trust was almost crushing. But beneath it, Gond felt something else—a clarity he’d never experienced before. This was why he’d been given divine power. Not just to heal individual wounds, but to stand between the innocent and those who would harm them.

“This is our time,” called out Grond to the onlookers. “Today we make our stand.”

The crowd stirred uneasily. Someone called out, “But there are too many of them\!”

“Trust in Alanyi,” Gond said, his voice gaining confidence. “Today we learn that sometimes, when the cause is just, fifty isn’t always more than two hundred.”

He could see the doubt in their faces, the fear that he was asking them to die for his pride. But he could also see something else—a spark of hope, of defiance, of the same spirit that had brought them all here in the first place.

“Silviana,” he called. The elf appeared at his side as if she’d been waiting for his summons. “Can you and Sim organize the non-combatants? Get them into the palisade, and protect them as you can.”

Around them, the settlement transformed with desperate efficiency. Fighters took up positions for ambush and defense. Mothers shepherded their children to the palisade.

“And you?” she asked.

Gond looked toward the approaching slavers, then back at the people depending on him. “I’m going to remind them why legends are dangerous things to hunt.”

As the settlement transformed itself into a fortress, Gond found himself thinking about Pell’s question. What did he want, if not revenge?

The answer came to him as he watched families helping each other prepare for battle, as he saw former slaves taking up weapons to defend their new home, as he felt the divine light stirring within him in response to their courage.

He wanted this. This community, this purpose, this chance to build something better than what had come before. He wanted to protect the innocent, heal the wounded, and stand as a beacon of hope in a world that had forgotten what hope looked like.

It wasn’t the life he’d planned, but it was the life he’d chosen. And as the first slavers emerged from the tree line, weapons gleaming in the morning sun, Gond found himself grateful for the choice.

The legend of the healer in the hills was about to become something else entirely. And for the first time since awakening in chains, Gond was exactly where he wanted to be.

The slavers advanced with professional precision, their formation tight and disciplined. Their shields locked with practiced efficiency, spears angled at identical degrees, each rider maintaining perfect spacing despite the uneven terrain. At their head rode a man in expensive armor, his face hidden behind a helm decorated with silver inlay. Behind him came the foot soldiers—hardened men with the look of veterans, their weapons well-maintained and their movements coordinated.

Gond stood at the settlement’s edge, flanked by Pell and Lira, watching the approaching force with tactical eyes. Fifty-three by his count, all mounted, all armed with crossbows in addition to their melee weapons. A formidable force by any measure.

“They’re not here to negotiate,” Pell observed.

“No,” Gond agreed. “They’re here to collect a bounty.”

The lead rider raised his hand, and the formation halted just outside crossbow range. He removed his helm, revealing a scarred face and cold, calculating eyes.

“I am Captain Voss of the Crimson Company,” he called out, his voice carrying easily across the distance. “I seek the one called the Healer. Surrender him to us, and the rest of you may go free.”

A murmur ran through the defenders. Some looked hopefully at Gond, as if he might actually consider the offer. But Gond had seen enough of the slave trade to know how such promises ended.

“And if I refuse?” he called back.

Voss smiled, the expression cold and predatory. “Then we take you anyway, and sell the rest of these rabble to cover our expenses. Your choice, Healer. Die a hero, or let your followers pay the price for your pride.”

It was a clever tactic—isolate the leader, make him responsible for whatever happened next. Gond had used similar approaches himself, back in his mercenary days. The difference was, he’d never been on the receiving end before.

“Counter-offer,” Gond said, his voice carrying the authority he’d learned to project. “Turn around and leave. Find easier prey. Because if you attack this settlement, I promise you won’t like what happens next.”

Voss laughed, the sound harsh and mocking. “Threats from a jumped-up hedge wizard? I think not.” He raised his hand again, and crossbows appeared along the slaver line. “Last chance, Healer. Come quietly, or watch your people die.”

The familiar warmth kindled beneath Gond’s sternum, spreading like wine through his veins, but this time it carried a different quality—sharper, more focused, like molten steel rather than honey. His muscles tensed with sudden strength, and he could feel his heartbeat synchronizing with something vast and implacable. The same divine force that could mend broken bones could also strengthen them beyond normal limits. The same power that could heal wounds could also prevent them from occurring in the first place.

“Pell,” he said quietly. “When I give the signal, tell everyone to charge.”

“Charge?” The thief’s voice cracked slightly. “Gond, they have crossbows. We’ll be cut down before we get halfway—”

“Trust me.”

Gond stepped forward, placing himself between the slavers and his people. He could feel their eyes on him—two hundred souls looking to him for salvation, for another miracle. And perhaps, he thought, that’s exactly what they would get.

“Captain Voss,” he called out. “You came here hunting a legend. I hope you’re prepared for what you find.”

Gond drew his sword. Divine light exploded outward from it like a physical force, washing over the settlement in a wave of golden radiance. Where it touched the defenders, it left them stronger, faster, more resilient. Where it reached the slavers, it did something else entirely—the light seared their eyes like staring into the sun, made their skin crawl with an electric tingling that spoke of judgment and retribution. Several horses reared, their riders struggling to control mounts that suddenly wanted nothing more than to flee from the terrible purity bearing down on them.

For a moment, the battlefield was silent except for the sound of horses shifting nervously and men muttering prayers. The slavers drew back even as they leaned forward, hands reaching out then pulling away, their faces caught between wonder and terror. Then Voss raised his crossbow, his face twisted with sudden fear and fury.

“Kill them all\!” he screamed.

Crossbow bolts flew, a dark swarm against the sudden, blinding flare of Gond’s light. The radiance pulsed, a tangible shield, and most shafts flew wildly off course, their aim spoiled by the searing glare that forced slavers to squint and turn their heads. A few bolts struck home, not with the wet thud of flesh, but with sharp cracks as they glanced off shields or armor, the impact staggering defenders but drawing no blood, as if an unseen hand had deflected them.

Horses shrieked, eyes rolling white, and several riders, caught off guard by their mounts’ terror, tumbled heavily to the churned earth. Recovering with curses, the remaining slavers spurred their horses forward, a wave of steel and leather.

The settlement’s newer recruits, faces pale but jaws set, formed a ragged line, their pikes a bristling, uneven hedge. Fear was a cold knot in their bellies, visible in the tremor of their spear-shafts, but they held. The charge, meant to shatter them, stumbled against the unexpected resilience of the pike wall, horses shying from the points, riders forced to pull up short or risk impalement.

Then Gond, a figure wreathed in golden light, was upon them. “For the Valley\! For Alanyi\!” His voice, amplified by the divine power, cut through the din. Pell, a dark blur at his flank, darted in and out, his short blades finding gaps in armor. Lira, her face a mask of concentration, shot one arrow after another into the mass of attackers. The more experienced defenders surged with Gond and Pell, each fighting with the fury of three, their desperate courage fanned into a blaze by Gond’s presence. Slavers cried out as they were dragged from saddles or met by a flurry of blows that overwhelmed their defenses.

Gond himself seemed an omnipresent force. One moment, his sword sang a high, clear note as it parried a captain’s thrust, the next he was a shield before a faltering novice, his light flaring to turn aside a killing blow. He moved through the chaos not as a single man, but as a manifestation of the valley’s will to survive, his presence a rallying point, his light a beacon against the encroaching darkness.

   
 

# **Chapter 15: Burden of Grace**

The victory had come at a price.  
Gond knelt beside the still form of young Willem, one of the settlement’s newest arrivals—a boy of perhaps sixteen who’d taken up a sword for the first time in his life three hours ago. Now he lay motionless on the bloodstained grass, his chest rising and falling in shallow, labored breaths.

“Internal bleeding,” Sim said quietly, his hands already stained red from his examination. “The crossbow bolt went deep. I’ve done what I can, but…”

But it wasn’t enough. Gond could see that much without divine sight. The boy’s skin had taken on the waxy pallor that spoke of life ebbing away, and his breathing grew more ragged with each passing moment.

Around them, the settlement bore the scars of battle. The slavers had been routed—those who survived the initial charge had fled into the forest, leaving behind their dead and wounded. Captain Voss himself lay among the fallen, his expensive armor no protection against the fury of people fighting for their homes.

It should have been a moment of triumph. Instead, Gond’s shoulders sagged as if invisible stones had been piled upon them, each fallen defender adding to the burden that pressed down on his spine.

“How many?” he asked.

“Seven dead,” Pell reported, his voice carefully neutral. “Twelve wounded, three seriously. Including young Willem.” He paused. “Could have been much worse.”

Could have been. But Willem was dying, and two other defenders lay nearby in grave condition.

Gond placed his hands on Willem’s chest, feeling for the familiar stirring of divine power. It came readily, flowing through him like warm honey. The divine light sought out the damaged places within the boy’s body—the internal bleeding, the shattered ribs, the trauma that went deeper than flesh.

The healing began, golden light suffusing Willem’s broken form. Gond felt the boy’s wounds responding, blood vessels mending, bones knitting together. For a moment, hope flared in his chest. Willem’s breathing steadied, color returning to his pale cheeks.

*Then, like a gentle but unmistakable pressure against his consciousness, came Alanyi’s voice: Ease his suffering, my son. But his path ends here. Provide comfort, not healing. His spirit yearns for release.*  
Gond’s hands trembled. The divine instruction was clear, undeniable. But Willem was so young, had fought so bravely. Surely the goddess would want him to live, to see the world they were building.

“No,” Gond whispered, pouring more power into the healing. “I can save him. I can—”

The warmth that had filled his chest suddenly drained away, leaving behind a hollow ache that echoed with each heartbeat. His fingertips, which had tingled with divine energy moments before, now felt cold and numb. The golden light flickered and died, abandoning him to channel his own mortal will against death itself. Sweat beaded on Gond’s forehead as he fought to continue the healing without divine support. The effort was enormous, like trying to fill a river with a bucket. His vision blurred, his hands shook, and he felt something fundamental within himself beginning to tear.

Around him, he could hear voices—Sim urging him to stop, Silviana speaking urgently in elven, others calling out in alarm as they saw him collapsing.

Willem’s eyes fluttered open, meeting Gond’s for a brief moment. The boy’s lips moved, forming words too quiet to hear. Then his chest stilled, and the light faded from his gaze.

Gond’s hands fell away as consciousness fled. He collapsed beside Willem’s body.

He regained consciousness in the healer’s tent. Sim and Silviana were sitting beside him.

“Where are the other wounded?” asked Gond.

Sim’s expression was pained. “You’ve been out for five days. Silviana and I together were able to save Peska, but Sif…”

Gond closed his eyes. The corners of his mouth drew back in a grimace.

“You did everything you could,” Sim said gently.

“Did I, Sim? Did I really?” Gond’s voice was a ragged whisper. “She *told* me. Alanyi. Said to let him go, ease his pain… let him find peace. But I was too damn stubborn. Thought I knew better than a goddess.” He choked back a sound that was half sob, half snarl. “And Sif… Sif’s dead because of my bloody pride.”

“Gond—”

“Nine people died because they believed in me. Because they thought the ‘Healer in the Hills’ could protect them from anything.” He looked up at Sim, his eyes hollow. “And when the goddess herself gave me clear instruction, I ignored it. What kind of paladin does that make me?”

Before Sim could answer, Silviana spoke up. The elf’s usually serene expression was troubled, her ancient eyes reflecting a pain that went deeper than the day’s losses.

“Come,” she said simply. “There is something you need to see.”

She led him away from the battlefield, through the settlement and up the slope toward the old temple ruins where they’d first practiced channeling divine power. Gond followed, still weak but able to walk. Instead of stopping at their usual meditation spot, Silviana continued climbing, following a path Gond had never noticed before.

The trail wound through dense forest, marked only by occasional stones that seemed to have been placed with deliberate care. As they climbed higher, the sounds of the settlement faded below them, replaced by the whisper of wind through ancient trees.

“Where are we going?” Gond asked.

“To a place of answers,” Silviana replied. “Or perhaps, to a place where the right questions become clear.”

They emerged into a circular clearing dominated by a single massive oak tree. The bark was deeply furrowed, each groove and ridge telling the story of countless seasons. The scent of rich earth and growing things filled the air, while overhead, the canopy rustled with a sound like distant voices sharing ancient secrets. The tree’s branches spread overhead like a living cathedral, and at its base, carved into the bark itself, was a symbol Gond recognized—the intertwined circles of Alanyi, goddess of peace and mercy.

“Every paladin of Alanyi has a tree that marks their connection,” said Silviana without preamble. “Alanyi bid me to carve this symbol for you, making this your tree.”

Gond approached the tree slowly, his fingers tracing the worn grooves of the carving. The bark felt warm beneath his touch, as if life pulsed just beneath the surface. “How many paladins have there been?”

“Fewer than you might think. More than the world remembers.” Silviana’s voice carried the weight of centuries. “Each one faced the same crisis you face now—the moment when divine power proves insufficient to prevent all suffering, when the burden of choice becomes too heavy to bear.”

“And what happened to them?”

“Some broke under the weight. They abandoned their calling, convinced they were unworthy of divine grace.” Silviana’s eyes were distant, remembering. “Others became consumed by their power, believing themselves above mortal concerns. Both paths lead to the same destination—the loss of what makes a paladin truly effective.”

Gond slumped against the ancient bark, the rough surface a small comfort. “And the others? The ones who didn’t break or go mad with power?”

“They learned the hardest lesson, Gond. That this power… it’s not about stopping every tear, every death. It’s about trusting that Alanyi sees a bigger picture, a pattern we can’t. That sometimes, true mercy is… letting go.”

The words were like hammer blows. “So I’m just supposed to… what? Nod and say ‘fair enough’ that Willem’s dead? That I spat in Alanyi’s eye because I was too arrogant to listen?”

“You are supposed to accept that Willem died because it was his time, and Alanyi knew his spirit was ready for release. That seven good people died because they chose to stand against evil, knowing the cost.” Silviana turned to face him, her expression gentle but implacable. “Your defiance was not malice, Gond—it was love. But divine wisdom encompasses more than mortal understanding.”

“But I nearly died trying to save him—”

“And that taught you something crucial about the relationship between divine will and mortal desire.” She placed a hand on his shoulder. “The gods do not give us power to override their judgment, but to serve their greater purpose. The question is not whether you can save everyone—it is whether you will learn to trust divine guidance even when your heart rebels against it.”

Gond closed his eyes, feeling the weight of her words settle over him. In the distance, he could hear the sounds of the settlement—people rebuilding, tending to the wounded, preparing for whatever came next. They were continuing on despite their losses, finding strength in each other and in the hope he’d helped kindle. He stayed there for a long time, the ancient oak a silent witness to his turmoil. Eventually, he rose, the stiffness in his limbs a dull echo of the ache in his spirit, and made his way back down to the valley.

Two days later, the raw edge of grief had settled into a heavy quiet that lay over the valley like the morning mist. Nine fresh mounds of earth marked the resting place of those who had fallen defending their new home. Gond stood before them as the first light of dawn touched the peaks, the air cold and still. He had visited at dusk the day before, and again now, a silent vigil for Willem, for Sif, for the seven others whose names were now etched into the valley’s memory. His shoulders were slumped, not from physical exhaustion, but from a weariness that settled deep in his bones. He ran a hand over the rough wood of a hastily made grave marker, the name ‘Willem’ barely legible.

A twig snapped behind him.

Gond’s body tensed as he turned.

A figure emerged from the tree line—a dwarf, but unlike any he’d encountered before. This one wore armor that gleamed with more than mere polish, inscribed with runes that seemed to shift and flow in the pale light. His beard was iron-gray, braided with small metal rings that chimed softly as he moved. At his belt, he carried a warhammer that radiated an aura of barely contained power.

The dwarf’s gaze took in the scene – the fresh graves, Gond’s solitary figure. “A heavy price for peace.” His voice was rough, accented with the cadence of mountain folk.

“Who are you?” Gond asked simply.

“Thorek Ironheart, of the Iron Covenant.” The dwarf’s eyes fixed on Gond with an intensity that was almost physical. “Word reached us of a battle here. And of a man leading the defense, a paladin of Alanyi, some said.” He gestured to the graves. “I see I was late to the dance, but the music lingers.”

Gond’s posture didn’t ease. “And what do you find, now that you’re here?”

Thorek studied him for a long moment, his eyes moving from Gond’s face, still etched with sleeplessness and sorrow, to the sword at his side. The dwarf’s expression shifted, a flicker of professional interest replacing his initial assessment.

“May I?” Thorek gestured toward the weapon.

Gond hesitated, then drew his blade and offered it hilt-first. The silver steel caught the dawn light, its surface unmarked despite the battle.

Thorek took the sword with the reverence of a master craftsman, his calloused fingers running along the fuller, testing the balance, examining the edge with an expert’s eye. His breathing grew shallow as he studied the weapon, turning it this way and that. The dwarf’s weathered hands traced the blade’s surface with the delicate touch of someone who understood metal at its most fundamental level. He held it up, squinted at the grain of the steel, even brought it close to his ear and tapped it gently with one thick finger, listening to the tone it produced.

“By Turin’s hammer,” he whispered, his voice filled with awe. “This is no mortal blade.”

“What do you mean?” Gond asked, his own weariness momentarily forgotten.

The dwarf looked up, his eyes wide with something approaching religious fervor. “I have worked metal for over two centuries, lad. I have forged weapons for kings and heroes, blades that have carved their names into legend. But this…” He held the sword up, watching light play along its perfect edge. “The steel is too pure, the balance too perfect. The edge holds a sharpness that should be impossible to maintain. And the way it resonates when struck—it sings with harmonics I’ve never heard from earthly metal. This is beyond my ability to forge. Beyond any mortal smith’s ability.”

“Silviana spoke of weapons transformed by divine will,” Gond murmured.

“Silviana is right,” Thorek replied, carefully returning the weapon to Gond’s hands, “You carry a blade touched by the divine. The steel itself has been blessed, transformed into something that exists as much in the realm of spirit as in the world of flesh.”

Gond stared at the sword, remembering the sword’s seeming transformation from iron to silver sword-steel.

Thorek looked from the sword to the graves, then back to Gond. “I came seeking a paladin. I find a man who stands guard over his dead, who carries their loss like a shield. A man willing to burn out his own soul to heal the wounded, even when it nearly kills him. A leader who grieves for every soul he couldn’t save.” The dwarf’s expression softened slightly. “I find a paladin, right enough. One who’s learning the hard way that even a god’s chosen champion can’t walk the path without allies.”

“Allies?” Gond echoed, the word tasting foreign on his tongue, still thick with grief.

“The Iron Covenant has watched the corruption of the Marshal Order for two centuries,” Thorek said, his voice carrying the weight of old anger. “We have seen Turin’s teachings twisted to serve those who would enslave the innocent. It began when the kingdom banned worship of Gorlatch—the old evil god—and his followers went underground, infiltrating other orders. The corruption spread like poison through the ranks.” His expression darkened. “We have waited for a sign that the old alliance between our peoples might be renewed.”

He stepped forward, extending his hand to Gond. “Your victory here was not won by divine power alone. It was won by people standing together, fighting for something greater than themselves. That is the true strength of a paladin—not the miracles you can work, but the hope you can inspire in others.”

Gond looked at the offered hand. Slowly, he reached out and clasped the dwarf’s forearm in the traditional warrior’s greeting. As their hands met, Thorek spoke a phrase in the old dwarven tongue, his voice carrying the weight of ritual and ceremony. The metal rings in his beard chimed softly, and for a moment, the air itself seemed to thrum with significance.

“The Iron Covenant offers its aid,” Thorek said formally. “Our weapons, our knowledge, our strength in the battles to come. But more than that, we offer partnership—the chance to rebuild what was broken, to restore the alliance that once stood against the darkness.”

“And in return?”

Thorek’s smile was fierce and proud. “In return, you continue being what you are—a beacon of hope in a world that has forgotten what hope looks like. You stand against the slavers and their corrupt allies. You show the world that divine power still flows to those worthy of it.”

Gond felt something shift inside him—not the divine power he’d grown accustomed to, but something more fundamental. The crushing weight of solitary responsibility began to ease, replaced by the strength that came from shared purpose.

“There will be more battles,” he said.

“Aye, there will.”

“More losses. More hard choices.”

“Aye. But you will not make them alone.”

Gond looked towards the settlement, where the sounds of life were beginning to stir. Smoke rose from cooking fires, and the distant clang of a hammer on metal spoke of rebuilding.

It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t safe. But it was real, and it was worth fighting for.

“When do we start?” he asked.

Thorek’s grin was answer enough.

The war council convened that evening around the central fire, the flickering flames casting dancing shadows across the faces of those gathered. Gond sat with Thorek on his right and Silviana—who had greeted the dwarf’s arrival with quiet understanding earlier in the day—on his left. Pell, Sim, and Lira completed the circle. Around them, the settlement had settled into its nightly routines, but there was an undercurrent of anticipation in the air, fueled by the news of the dwarf’s arrival and the alliance he brought.

“The attack by the slavers was not random,” Thorek said without preamble. “The Crimson Company is—was—one of the most professional slaver outfits on the continent. They don’t move without significant payment and solid intelligence.”

“Someone hired them specifically to take me,” Gond said. It wasn’t a question.

“Aye. And when they failed to return, their employers will send others. Larger forces, better equipped, more ruthless.” The dwarf’s expression was grim. “You have perhaps a month before the next attack. Maybe less.”

“Then we need to be ready,” Pell said. “Better defenses, more fighters, escape routes—”

“No.” Gond’s voice, though quiet, sliced through the planning. “No more running. No more hiding.”

The circle fell silent, all eyes on him. He saw their questions, the same ones that had gnawed at him since Willem died.

“We’ve been reacting,” he said, his gaze sweeping over them. “Waiting for them to hit us, patching the walls, mourning our dead. That’s not living. That’s just… waiting for the end. And it’s not enough. Not while this scum still draws breath and deals in chains.”

Silviana’s eyes, ancient and knowing, met his. “What are you saying, Gond?”

“I’m saying we stop cowering. We take the fight *to them*.” His voice gained strength, a spark of the old fire, but tempered now with a weary resolve. “The slavers, the ones who pay them, the whole rotten system. We burn it down. And we build something decent from the ashes.”

Thorek leaned forward, a slow grin spreading across his face. “That’s not a battle you’re talking about, son. That’s a war.”

“Then it’s a war,” Gond said, the words settling over the fire like a vow. “A war to give folk a chance to live free, without looking over their shoulder every day.”

“The Iron Covenant has been preparing for such a war for two centuries,” Thorek said slowly. “We have weapons, siege engines, warriors trained in the old ways. But we have lacked something crucial—a cause that could unite the scattered forces of good.”

“And now?” Sim asked.

The dwarf’s smile was fierce and proud. “Now we have a paladin.”

As the council continued late into the night, planning and preparing for the battles to come, Gond felt the last of his doubt fade away. Willem’s death still grieved him, and he knew there would be more losses ahead. But he also knew that the boy’s sacrifice—and the sacrifice of all who had fallen—would not be in vain.

The weeks that followed were a blur of motion and relentless effort. The war council’s decision to take the fight to the slavers had unleashed a torrent of activity. Gond, Thorek, and Pell orchestrated a series of daring raids on slaver caravans and supply trains snaking through the foothills and along the less-guarded trade routes.

One such raid, targeting a caravan rumored to be carrying not only slaves but also a shipment of weapons for a slaver outpost, became a template for their operations. Pell’s scouts, a growing network of former slaves with an intimate knowledge of the terrain and slaver tactics, had pinpointed the caravan’s route through a narrow defile.

Under the cover of a moonless night, Gond led a mixed force of thirty fighters—veteran defenders of the valley, newly trained recruits eager to prove themselves, and a core of Thorek’s hardened dwarven warriors. They moved like shadows, their approach masked by the sighing of the wind through the rocks.

The attack was swift and brutal. The slavers, overconfident in their numbers and the remoteness of the location, were caught completely by surprise. Arrows hissed from the darkness, felling guards in their tracks. Thorek’s dwarves, axes whistling, smashed through the caravan’s meager defenses, their battle cries echoing off the canyon walls. Gond, his divinely touched sword a silver gleam in the gloom, moved through the chaos, his presence a beacon for his fighters and a terror to their enemies. He focused on disabling guards, his strikes precise, his movements economical. He saw a young woman, no older than Willem, cowering as a slaver raised a sword. Gond’s sword flashed, and the slaver crumpled, his sword falling uselessly to the ground.

The fight was over in minutes. The surviving slavers threw down their weapons, their faces etched with disbelief and fear. The real prize, however, lay in the crude wooden cages and chained lines at the caravan’s center. Thirty men, women, and children, their eyes wide with a mixture of terror and dawning hope, were cut free.

The scene repeated itself, with variations, half a dozen times in the following month. Each successful raid brought a fresh wave of liberated souls to the valley. They arrived in a steady stream—gaunt, weary, often injured, but with a spark of defiance in their eyes. The valley, once a quiet sanctuary, buzzed with new life and purpose. The settlement swelled, new shelters rising almost daily.

Those who could fight, and chose to, were put to training. Thorek, with a gruff sort of patience, drilled them in the use of pike and shield, his voice barking commands that echoed through the training grounds. Pell, with his characteristic stealth, taught the art of moving unseen, of striking from the shadows. Even Sim found himself instructing newcomers in basic first aid, his gentle hands tending to the wounds of training as readily as those of battle. The clang of steel on steel became a familiar sound, a counterpoint to the hammering from Dax’s expanding construction crews and Korven’s busy forge, now supplemented by dwarven smiths who had arrived with Thorek.

Supplies, too, flowed into the valley. Captured weapons armed the new recruits. Confiscated food and coin bolstered their stores. Bolts of cloth, tools, and even livestock taken from the slavers’ supply trains were put to immediate use, easing the hardships of the growing community.

One morning, Gond stood watching Dax and a team of laborers, their faces grim with determination, as they worked to widen the narrow, winding path that was the only entrance to the valley. Rocks were being levered out of the way, trees felled, the treacherous track slowly being transformed into a defensible road.

Dax, his face streaked with sweat and dirt, paused in his efforts, looking up at Gond. “Making it easier for folks to get in, but also easier for trouble to find us, if we’re not careful.”

Gond nodded, his gaze sweeping over the transformed landscape – the bustling activity, the new faces, the grim set to the trainees’ jaws. This wasn’t just a hideout anymore.

“Time for hiding’s done, Dax,” Gond said, his voice quiet but carrying a new weight that made the nearby workers pause. “This isn’t just a sanctuary now. It’s a fortress. A beacon. Let ’em come. We’ll be ready.”

His words, and the sentiment behind them, spread through the valley like wildfire, igniting a fresh wave of resolve. The path widening became a symbol of their new intent, a declaration to the world that they would no longer cower in the shadows.

   
 

# **Chapter 16: The Network Revealed**

A sign that everything was about to change came with the morning mist—a column of riders approaching from the south, moving with the disciplined precision of a military unit. The valley’s defenders, more numerous and better organized than they had been mere weeks ago, sounded the alarm from newly reinforced watchtowers that now studded the widened valley entrance. These weren’t slavers. The banners they carried bore symbols Gond didn’t recognize, and at their head rode a figure he knew all too well.  
“Maera,” Pell said, lowering his spyglass from the main watchtower, a more robust structure than the one that had stood there previously. His own gear was newer, his armor showing the polish of recent acquisition. “But she’s not alone.”

Gond stood on the watchtower platform, the morning air cool against his face. Below, the settlement was already stirring, the sounds of a small, bustling town replacing the quieter hum of a fledgling refuge. Smoke rose from numerous cookfires, and the clang of hammers from multiple forges—Korven’s original and a larger, newer setup manned by Thorek’s kin—provided a steady rhythm. He studied the approaching group. Twenty riders, all armed and armored, but weapons sheathed, right hand up and palm outward in the warrior’s sign of peace. And at their center, unmistakable despite the distance, was the elderly healer who’d first set him on this path.

“How many?” Thorek asked, joining them on the platform. The dwarf’s own armor gleamed, and the warriors accompanying him bore well-maintained weapons, a testament to the recent influx of supplies. The past month had seen Thorek and his Iron Covenant dwarves working tirelessly, transforming the valley’s defenses and its defenders.

“Twenty mounted, maybe more following on foot,” Pell reported, his gaze sweeping the column. “Mixed group—some look like soldiers, others like civilians. They seem to be navigating the widened path with relative ease. And there’s something else.” He handed the spyglass to Gond. “Look at the rear guard.”

Gond adjusted the focus and felt his breath catch. Bringing up the rear of the column, several sturdy oxen strained to pull heavy sledges along the now-passable road. These were laden with an array of strange contraptions, stacks of thick timber, and numerous bands of steel that glowed faintly with an inner, magical light. Dwarven runes, intricate and potent, were etched into the metal, pulsing softly. Beside the sledges, directing their careful movement over the improved terrain, was a dwarf even larger than Thorek, nearly as wide as he was tall.

“Grimjaw Ironforge,” Thorek breathed, his voice filled with something between awe and disbelief. “What in Turin’s name is he doing here?”

“You know him?” Gond asked.

“Know him? Lad, Grimjaw is the finest siege engineer in the known world. His engines have broken more fortress walls than any other dwarf alive.” Thorek’s expression was troubled. “But he serves the Crown of Ironhold. Has for thirty years. What would bring him here, to a place that was a hidden goat track only weeks ago?”

They had their answer within the hour, as the column reached the settlement’s now clearly defined and guarded entrance. Maera dismounted with the fluid grace of someone half her age. But it was the woman beside her who commanded immediate attention—tall, regal, with the bearing of someone accustomed to command. Her armor was practical but well-made, and the sword at her side showed the wear of frequent use. As she dismounted, her feet found the ground in a perfect fighting stance—weight balanced, knees slightly bent, one hand resting casually on her sword hilt while her eyes swept the settlement’s improved defenses, the disciplined ranks of its new fighters, and the general air of bustling preparedness with professional assessment.

“Gond,” Maera said, approaching with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “You’ve been busy since we last met.”

“Maera.” Gond clasped her hands in greeting. “You look… different.”

“War changes everyone,” she replied simply. Then, turning to her companion, “Allow me to present Captain Elena Brightblade, formerly of the Royal Guard of Westmarch.”

The woman stepped forward, her movement flowing in the way of a trained warrior—shoulders square, spine straight, each step deliberate and controlled. Her gaze assessed Gond with professional interest, taking in his posture, the way he carried his sword, the confidence in his bearing. “So you’re the one they’re calling the Healer in the Hills. You’re younger than I expected.”

“And you’re farther from Westmarch than I’d expect a Royal Guard to be,” Gond replied carefully.

Elena’s smile was sharp as a blade. “Former Royal Guard. I resigned my commission when I learned what my king was really funding with his tax revenues.” Her expression darkened. “Turns out the slave trade has more friends in high places than I’d realized.”

Before Gond could respond, a commotion from the rear of the column drew their attention. The massive dwarf—Grimjaw, presumably—was bellowing orders, directing a team of his own sturdy apprentices as they began to unload the sledges with surprising speed. They laid out the timbers, the glowing steel bands, and the various intricate contraptions with practiced efficiency. Even in their disassembled state, the components hinted at formidable power. Gond could already imagine how these pieces might fit together—the gleam of bronze fittings, the rune-etched steel promising devastating force.

Gond noticed how the settlement’s inhabitants—a mix of long-term refugees and scores of newly liberated individuals—gathered to watch. Their faces showed less raw fear and more curious assessment than they might have a month prior. They had seen battle, participated in raids, and were now part of a community actively fighting back. Amazement was still plain as they took in the array of components and the promise of the war machines to come. Children pointed with trembling fingers at the glowing steel bands, their parents drawing them closer, but with a sense of wonder now tinged with the understanding that these tools were for *their* defense, *their* fight. The sounds of Korven’s original forge and Dax’s carpentry crews were now augmented by the rhythmic clang of Thorek’s dwarven smiths and the organized industry of a war camp. This new arrival of materials and expertise for weapons of war spoke of an escalation, but one they were increasingly prepared for.

“Grimjaw\!” Thorek called out, striding toward his kinsman. “What brings you to this place?”

The larger dwarf looked up from his work, his face splitting into a grin that revealed teeth capped with gold. “Thorek Ironheart\! Should have known you’d be mixed up in this madness.” He gestured towards the piles of timber and glowing steel. “As for what brings me here—let’s just say I got tired of building weapons for people who use them on the innocent.”

“You defected?” Thorek’s voice was carefully neutral, but Gond caught the undercurrent of hope.

“Defected, resigned, told the Crown to stuff their gold where the sun don’t shine—call it what you will.” Grimjaw’s expression grew serious. “But when word reached me that a paladin of Alanyi had risen, that the old alliance might be renewed… well, some things are more important than steady pay.”

He gestured toward the unloaded components and the heavily laden oxen. “Brought more than just myself, too—components for some of my beauties, and enough tools to outfit a real forge. I hear tell your man Korven’s been doing good work, and Thorek’s lads have certainly been busy”—he nodded towards the newer, larger forge already smoking nearby—“but if you’re planning to take on fortified cities, you’ll need weapons that can punch through stone walls.”

Gond’s shoulders straightened. The weight of leadership was familiar now, the initial shock replaced by a steady resolve. These weren’t just desperate refugees seeking miracles anymore; many of his people were becoming seasoned, and these newcomers were professionals, soldiers and leaders who’d made calculated decisions to join his cause, drawn by word of his actions.

“Any more coming?” he asked Maera.

The elderly woman’s smile was enigmatic. “That depends on how well this meeting goes. But first, there are things you need to understand about what you’ve started here.”

She led them to the settlement’s council area, where a crowd had gathered to witness the arrival of so many newcomers. As they settled around the central fire, Maera gestured for silence.

“For the past month, especially,” she began, “I’ve been traveling. Not as a simple healer, but as a messenger, carrying word of the victories won and the slaves freed by those in this valley. News of your raids travels fast, Gond. Faster than you might think.”

“What kind of people have you been meeting?” Pell asked, his thief’s instincts clearly on alert.

“The kind who’ve been waiting for a sign that change is possible,” Elena answered. “Soldiers who’ve grown sick of enforcing unjust laws. Merchants who’ve lost family to slavers. Nobles who remember when honor meant something more than profit.”

Maera nodded. “The network has been growing for years—people connected by shared disgust at what our world has become. But we’ve lacked something crucial: a symbol, a leader, a cause that could unite us.”

“And now?” Gond asked.

“Now we have the Healer of the Hills,” Maera said, her voice carrying conviction. “The paladin who doesn’t just defend, but attacks. Who strikes at the heart of the slave trade, offers hope to the hopeless, and protection to the innocent. The man who proved that divine power still flows to those worthy of it, and that mortal courage can make that power manifest.”

Gond felt the familiar stirring of divine energy, responding to the faith and hope radiating from those around him. But beneath it was something else—a growing awareness of the scope of what was being offered to him.

“How many?” he asked quietly.

“In the immediate area? Perhaps two hundred fighters, scattered across a dozen groups.” Elena’s voice was matter-of-fact. “Across the continent? Thousands. Maybe tens of thousands, if the right call goes out.”

The numbers were staggering. Gond had grown accustomed to thinking in terms of his settlement’s population—a few hundred souls at most. The idea of commanding thousands was both exhilarating and terrifying.

“And what do they want in return?” Thorek asked pragmatically.

“Victory,” Grimjaw said bluntly. “An end to the slave trade and the corruption that enables it. A chance to build something better than what we’ve got now.”

“That’s not a small request,” Sim observed quietly.

“No,” Maera agreed. “It’s not. But then, small requests don’t require paladins.”

As the discussion continued, Gond found himself studying the faces around him. These weren’t the desperate refugees who’d first sought him out, driven by immediate need and personal tragedy. These were professionals, people who’d made calculated decisions based on strategic thinking and long-term planning.

It was both humbling and intimidating.

“There’s something else,” Elena said, her voice cutting through the tactical discussions. “Intelligence we’ve gathered about your enemies’ response to recent events.”

The circle fell silent, all attention focused on the former Royal Guard.

“The attack by the Crimson Company wasn’t an isolated incident,” she continued. “It was a test—a probe to determine your capabilities and weaknesses. When Captain Voss failed to return, it sent a message to some very powerful people.”

“What kind of message?” Gond asked.

“That you’re a genuine threat. Not just to individual slaver operations, but to the entire system that enables them.” Elena’s expression was grim. “They’re organizing a response. Multiple companies, coordinated attacks, political pressure on anyone who might support you.”

“How long do we have?” Thorek asked.

“Weeks, maybe a month. But when they come, it won’t be fifty slavers with crossbows. It’ll be hundreds, possibly thousands, with their own war machines and magical support.”

The weight of her words settled over the gathering like a physical presence. Gond felt the divine power stirring within him, responding to the threat against those under his protection. But he also felt something else—a clarity of purpose that cut through the fear and uncertainty.

The familiar pulse flickered through him, weaker than before but still unmistakable—that echo of blazing light from Dax’s healing, from Mira’s restoration. And he remembered painfully his failure with Willem. The memory lasted only a moment, but it left him with the growing awareness that his strength was not infinite.

“Then we don’t wait for them to come to us,” he said quietly.

“What do you mean?” Maera asked.

Gond stood, his gaze sweeping across the assembled faces. “I mean we take the fight to them before they can organize their response.”

“That’s a significant escalation,” Elena warned. “Caravans are one thing, but once you start actively attacking slaver operations, there’s no going back. You’ll be committed to total war.”

“We’re already committed,” Gond replied. “The moment I chose to heal instead of hide, the moment I decided to build something instead of just surviving—we were committed. The only question is whether we fight on our terms or theirs.”

Grimjaw’s laugh rumbled like distant thunder, his eyes brightening as his weathered face creased into deep lines of anticipation. His massive hands rubbed together with barely contained eagerness. “Now that’s the kind of talk I like to hear\! Time to get these beauties assembled\! My hands have been idle too long.”

“The Iron Covenant stands ready,” Thorek added formally. “Our weapons, our warriors, our knowledge—all at your disposal.”

“And your network?” Gond asked, looking at Maera.

The elderly woman’s smile was fierce and proud. “The network has been waiting for this moment for years. Give the word, and you’ll have more allies than you know what to do with.”

Gond felt the weight of decision settling on his shoulders, but this time it didn’t feel crushing. Instead, it felt like destiny—the culmination of everything that had brought him to this point.

“Then let’s give them something to really worry about,” he said.

The planning session that followed stretched late into the night, maps and intelligence reports spread across every available surface. What emerged was a picture of the slave trade that was both more extensive and more vulnerable than Gond had realized.

“We need to buy some time,” Gond said. “Redouble our attacks on their caravans and supply chains. Every caravan we liberate means more swords on our side, and forces them to spread their strength to protect the others. Every supply train we hit strengthens us and weakens them.”

“That should be enough to postpone the slavers’ attack on the valley until we can meet it on our terms,” agreed Elena.

“And then we bring the fight to them,” answered Gond with a grim smile.

“The key is the coastal cities,” Elena explained, pointing to a series of marks on the largest map. “Blackwater, Westport, Ironhaven—they’re the major hubs where slaves are processed and shipped. Take out their operations, and you cripple the entire network.”

“Easier said than done,” Pell observed. “Those cities have walls, guards, political protection.”

“We’re not starting from nothing,” Gond interjected, gesturing toward the settlement around them. “Every slaver operation we’ve hit has added to our capabilities. The Crimson Company alone yielded fifty crossbows, two dozen swords, and enough chain mail to outfit our best fighters.”

Thorek nodded approvingly. “Aye, and the caravan raids have brought in more than just weapons. Gold from their strongboxes has let us purchase what we couldn’t make or capture.”

“Plus the defectors bring their own equipment,” Elena added.

“Walls can be broken,” Grimjaw said confidently, patting a stack of glowing steel bands. “Guards can be defeated. As for political protection…” He shrugged. “Hard to protect something that’s been reduced to rubble.”

“We’re not talking about destroying cities,” Gond said firmly. “We’re talking about liberating them. There’s a difference.”

“Aye, there is,” Thorek agreed. “But liberation sometimes requires force. The question is how much force, and how precisely applied.”

As they debated tactics and strategies, Gond found himself thinking about the people who would be caught in the middle of whatever conflict was coming. The slaves who needed liberation, yes, but also the ordinary citizens who’d been living under the current system without necessarily supporting it.

“What about the people?” he asked. “The ones who aren’t slavers or slaves, but just… people. Shopkeepers, craftsmen, farmers. What happens to them when we start tearing down their cities, deposing their rulers?”

The question brought a moment of silence to the planning session. It was Elena who finally answered.

“That’s what separates a liberation from a conquest,” she said quietly. “A conqueror doesn’t care about the people caught in the middle. A liberator makes them part of the solution.”

“Meaning?”

“Meaning we don’t just tear down the old system—we help build the new one. We show people that there’s a better way to live, a better way to organize society.” She gestured toward the settlement around them. “You’ve already started doing that here. The question is whether you can do it on a larger scale.”

Gond looked around at the faces gathered in the firelight—former soldiers and current refugees, dwarven engineers and elven lore-keepers, thieves and priests and healers. All of them united by a shared vision of something better than what they’d left behind.

“We can,” he said with quiet certainty. “We will.”

The interruption came just as the war council was breaking up—urgent voices from the settlement’s edge, the sound of people in distress. Gond looked up from the maps to see Sim hurrying toward them, his face grave.

“Gond,” the priest called out. “There’s a family at the gates. Refugees from Millhaven. They’ve been traveling for days, and…” He paused, his expression pained. “The grandmother is dying.”

Gond felt the familiar stirring of divine power.

“Show me,” he said.

The family huddled near the settlement’s entrance—a man and woman in their thirties, three children ranging from perhaps six to twelve, and an elderly woman who lay on a makeshift stretcher. Even from a distance, Gond could see the gray pallor of approaching death, the labored breathing that spoke of a body giving up its fight. The scent of sickness hung in the air—that particular mixture of fever sweat and something deeper, more final.

“This is Jorik and Mira,” Sim said quietly as they approached. “Their children—Tam, Bess, and little Fen. And this is Jorik’s mother, Grandmother Nessa.”

The old woman’s eyes fluttered open as Gond knelt beside her stretcher. Despite her condition, her gaze was clear and aware. Her breath came in shallow whispers, each exhalation carrying the faint rattle of fluid in her lungs. “You’re him,” she whispered. “The healer. I told them… told them we had to reach you.”

“Grandmother, save your strength,” Jorik said, his voice thick with grief. “The healer is here now. He’ll make you well.”

But as Gond placed his hands on the old woman’s chest, feeling for the familiar flow of divine power, he sensed something else—a gentle but unmistakable presence in his mind. Alanyi’s voice, soft as a whisper but clear as crystal: *Her time has come, my son. Ease her pain, but do not hold her spirit to this world. She has completed her purpose.*

Gond’s hands trembled slightly. The instruction was clear, just as it had been with Willem. But this time, he remembered the cost of defiance—the tearing sensation, the lesson learned too late.

“I understand,” he whispered, so quietly that only the goddess could hear.

Instead of the full healing power he might have channeled, Gond let only a gentle warmth flow through his hands. Not the blazing light that could mend bones and restore life, but a softer radiance that eased pain and brought peace. The old woman’s labored breathing grew easier, the lines of suffering smoothing from her face. The scent of sickness faded, replaced by something cleaner—like wildflowers after rain.

“Better?” he asked gently.

Grandmother Nessa smiled, her eyes bright despite her failing body. “Much better. The pain is… gone.” She turned her head toward her family. “Come close, all of you.”

As the family gathered around her, the old woman spoke in a voice that was weak but clear. “I need you to understand something. I’ve been ready to go for weeks now. The sickness… it should have taken me before we ever left Millhaven.”

“Grandmother, don’t say that,” young Bess whispered, tears streaming down her face.

“Hush, child. Listen.” Nessa’s gaze moved to each family member in turn. “I held on because you needed me to. Because you needed a reason to keep going, to make this journey. If I had died back home, you might have given up. Might have thought there was no point in seeking the healer.”

Jorik’s face crumpled. “We would have come anyway. For the children—”

“Would you?” Nessa asked gently. “Or would grief have made you think it was too dangerous, too uncertain? I know you, my son. You would have found reasons to stay, to accept what seemed inevitable.” She reached out with a trembling hand to touch his cheek. “I stayed because you needed hope. And now… now you’re here. You’re safe. The children will grow up free.”

Gond felt tears stinging his eyes as he watched the family’s grief and understanding war across their faces. The firelight flickered across the old woman’s peaceful features, casting gentle shadows that seemed to soften the lines etched in her face.

“I’m ready now,” the old woman said, her voice growing fainter. “Ready to meet Alanyi in the next world.”

She closed her eyes, her breathing growing shallow. The night air seemed to still around them, as if the world itself was holding its breath. Within minutes, her chest ceased its gentle rise and fall, her face peaceful in the firelight. The scent of wildflowers lingered for a moment longer, then faded into the cool night air.

The family wept, but it was the clean grief of acceptance rather than the bitter anguish of senseless loss. As they held each other, Gond stood slowly, feeling the weight of divine wisdom settling over him.

“You did the right thing,” Sim said quietly, appearing at his side. “I saw what you did—the healing that eased her pain without prolonging her suffering. That took wisdom.”

Gond nodded, thinking of Willem and the lesson learned through defiance. “Sometimes mercy means letting go,” he said, echoing Silviana’s words from that terrible day. “Sometimes the greatest healing is knowing when not to heal.”

As the family began the process of preparing Grandmother Nessa for burial, Gond returned to the dying fire where Elena and Maera waited. The weight of what they were planning—what he was committing to—was enormous. But for the first time since accepting his calling, he felt truly ready for what lay ahead.

He had learned to trust divine wisdom even when his heart rebelled against it. He had learned that being a paladin meant serving a purpose larger than his own understanding. And he had learned that sometimes the greatest strength came not from standing alone, but from standing with others who shared your vision of what the world could become.

PART IV  
*Forging a Free Nation*  
   
 

# **Chapter 17: Allies and Enemies**

The delegation arrived three days after Maera’s war council, announced by the sound of bells—not the harsh clang of alarm, but the melodious chiming of ceremonial instruments. From the watchtower, Gond could see them approaching: a procession of robed figures moving with the measured pace of religious ceremony, their banners bearing symbols he recognized from Sim’s teachings.  
“Holy orders,” Silviana said, joining him on the platform. Her usually serene expression was troubled. “Multiple orders, by the look of it.”

Gond counted the banners as they drew closer. The crossed hammers of Turin’s Battlemasters dominated the procession, their armor gleaming with a faint silver sheen despite the dust of travel, an occasional tiny spark crackling from hammer emblems—clearly the ascendant power among the holy orders. The intertwined circles of Alanyi were present but fewer, carried by only two figures who seemed diminished beside Turin’s representatives. And others he didn’t recognize: a golden sun, a silver moon, a stylized flame.

“They’re not here for healing,” Pell observed, appearing beside them with his usual silent grace. “Look at the formation—that’s a diplomatic mission, not a pilgrimage.”

Indeed, the approaching group moved with careful precision-they gave more an air of diplomats than priests. At their head rode a figure in elaborate robes, his bearing suggesting high rank within whatever hierarchy he represented.

“Trouble?” Thorek asked, climbing up to join them.

“Probably,” Gond replied. “The question is what kind.”

They had their answer within the hour, as the delegation reached the settlement’s edge and requested formal audience with “the one called Gond, who claims the title of Paladin.” The phrasing was carefully neutral, but Gond caught the underlying challenge.

“Those priests of Alanyi,” said Gond to Sim. “Recognize them?”

“The one I don’t know, but that woman must be sister Marta,” murmured Sim. “I’ve never met her, but know of her. She shares our sympathies.”

The meeting was arranged in the settlement’s council area, with representatives from both sides seated around the central fire. Gond took his place flanked by Silviana and Thorek, while Sim sat slightly apart—his position as a member of one of the visiting orders creating an obvious conflict of loyalties.

The leader of the delegation proved to be High Cleric Aldric, leader of Turin’s human order, a man whose expensive robes bore the crossed hammers of the god of justice. His soft hands spoke of a life spent far from the hardships his god supposedly championed. When he spoke, his voice carried the practiced authority of someone accustomed to being obeyed.

Beside him sat a thin, nervous priest in the faded robes of Alanyi—one of only two representatives of the once-mighty order. Brother Castor’s eyes darted constantly to Aldric, as if seeking approval for his very presence.

“Gond of the Valley,” Aldric began formally, “I come bearing greetings from the Council of Sacred Orders, and questions that require answers.”

“Ask them,” Gond replied simply.

Aldric’s smile was thin and cold. “Very well. By what authority do you claim the title of Paladin? Who ordained you? What tests did you pass? What vows did you swear?”

The questions hung in the air like accusations. Around the circle, shoulders stiffened and hands drifted toward weapon hilts. Thorek’s jaw clenched while Silviana’s fingers traced patterns on her staff. The visiting clerics leaned forward like predators scenting weakness, their gazes sharp and assessing.

“Peace,” murmured Gond to his companions. For a long moment, Gond studied the faces of the delegation.

“I claim no title,” Gond said finally. “I am what I am. The divine power that flows through me is its own authority.”

“Divine power?” Aldric’s tone suggested polite skepticism. “Many claim such things. Hedge wizards, charlatans, madmen—all insist their abilities come from the gods. What proof do you offer?”

“Yes, what proof?” Brother Castor echoed immediately, his voice shrill with nervous energy. “Charlatans and madmen, exactly as the High Cleric says. Where are your credentials? Your ordination papers?”

Before Gond could respond, Sim stood slowly. The gentle priest’s face was pale but determined as he faced his superior.

“High Cleric,” he said quietly, “I have witnessed this man’s power firsthand. I have seen him heal wounds that should have been fatal, inspire courage in the face of overwhelming odds, and channel divine light in ways that leave no doubt of its source.”

Aldric’s gaze shifted to Sim, and Gond caught a flash of something cold and calculating in the High Cleric’s eyes. “Brother Sim. Your reports have been… interesting. But personal testimony, however sincere, is not sufficient proof of divine calling.”

“Then what would be sufficient?” Silviana asked, her voice carrying the musical cadence of elven speech.

The High Cleric turned to her with obvious distaste. “And you are?”

“Silviana Starweaver, Lore-keeper of the Circle of Whispers.” Her introduction carried weight that even Aldric couldn’t ignore. “I speak for the elven communities that remember Alanyi’s true nature.”

“The elves withdrew from human affairs centuries ago,” Aldric said dismissively. “Your opinions carry little weight in matters of human religious authority.”

“Perhaps,” Silviana replied calmly. “But divine authority transcends human politics.”

The exchange was interrupted by the arrival of another figure—a dwarf in armor that bore the crossed hammers of Turin’s order, but with subtle differences that marked him as belonging to a different faction. He approached the circle with the confident stride of someone accustomed to command.

“Battlemaster Morgan Ironshield,” he announced himself, settling onto a log without waiting for invitation. “I represent the Iron Covenant’s interests in this matter.”

Aldric’s expression soured further. “The Iron Covenant has no standing in this discussion. You broke from the true faith two centuries ago.”

“We preserved the true faith,” Korgan replied bluntly. “While you corrupted it to serve slavers and tyrants.”

The accusation stirred an angry reaction among the delegation. Several of the visiting clerics rose to their feet, hands moving toward weapons, while Gond’s people tensed in response. For a moment, violence seemed inevitable.

“Enough,” Gond said, his voice carrying an authority that cut through the rising tension. “We’re not here to relitigate ancient grievances. High Cleric Aldric, you came seeking proof of divine calling. What would convince you?”

Aldric settled back into his seat, though his expression remained hostile. “The traditional tests. Theological examination by qualified scholars. Demonstration of specific divine abilities under controlled conditions. Submission to the authority of established religious hierarchy.”

“And if I refuse?”

“Then you would be declared a false prophet, your followers excommunicated, and your movement condemned as heretical.” Aldric’s smile was coldly satisfied. “The consequences would be… severe.”

“Severe indeed\!” Brother Castor added eagerly, wringing his hands. “Heretical movements must be stamped out before they spread their poison. The High Cleric speaks wisdom\!”

Gond felt the divine power stirring within him, responding to the threat against those under his protection. But this wasn’t a situation that could be resolved with healing or blessing. This was politics, pure and simple—an attempt to control or destroy what he’d built.

“I see,” he said quietly. “And what of the slaves who’ve been freed? The refugees who’ve found sanctuary? The hope that’s been kindled in the hearts of the oppressed? What happens to them if I submit to your authority?”

“That would depend,” Aldric replied carefully, “on how cooperative you prove to be.”

The implication was clear: submit, and perhaps some of what Gond had built would be allowed to continue under official oversight. Refuse, and it would all be swept away.

“There is another option,” Korgan said into the tense silence. “Recognition by the Iron Covenant and our allies. We may not have the political power of the established orders, but we have something more valuable—legitimacy in the eyes of those who remember what divine service truly means.”

“The Iron Covenant is a rebel faction,” one of the other visiting clerics protested. “They have no authority to grant recognition.”

“We have the authority of two millennia of faithful service,” Korgan replied. “The authority of standing against corruption when others embraced it. The authority of preserving divine truth when others perverted it for political gain.”

As the argument continued, Gond found himself studying the faces around him. The visiting clerics were clearly divided—some nodding along with Aldric’s demands, others shifting in their seats and avoiding eye contact with the High Cleric. His own people were watching him intently, waiting to see how he would respond to this challenge.

“May I ask a question?” Sim said suddenly, his quiet voice cutting through the debate.

Aldric turned to him with obvious irritation. “What is it, Brother?”

“When did the Order of Alanyi last send aid to the oppressed? When did we last stand against injustice, regardless of the political consequences?” Sim’s voice grew stronger as he continued. “When did we last act like servants of the goddess of mercy and redemption? When did we last challenge the priests of Kemiss who bless slave auctions and call commerce more sacred than compassion?”

The question hung in the air like an accusation. Aldric’s face flushed with anger. “The priests of Kemiss serve a legitimate deity. Commerce and trade are necessary for civilization—”

“Commerce built on human suffering is an abomination,” Korgan interrupted. “Turin teaches that justice comes before profit, always.”

“Easy words from those who don’t understand the complexities of governance,” Aldric shot back. “The world requires compromise, accommodation with existing power structures—”

“The world requires courage to stand against evil, regardless of the cost,” Silviana said quietly. “That is what separates divine service from political expedience.”

Before Aldric could respond, another voice joined the conversation.

“An excellent question,” said the second priest of Alanyi, stepping into the circle with the quiet confidence of someone accustomed to being heard. She was young, perhaps thirty, with the calloused hands of someone who worked for a living despite her clerical robes. “I’m Sister Marta of the Westport Temple. I’ve traveled here to see for myself what manner of man claims to serve our goddess.”

Aldric turned to her with obvious relief. “Sister Marta. Your timing is fortuitous. Perhaps you can help this pretender understand the importance of proper religious authority.”

But Marta’s attention was focused on Silviana, her eyes widened with wonder as she took in the elven lore-keeper’s presence. Her hands trembled slightly as she clasped them before her. “Lore-keeper Starweaver,” she said, inclining her head respectfully. “I have studied the old texts, the ones that speak of Alanyi’s true nature before the orders became… political. Your presence here suggests this man may indeed carry the ancient blessing.”

Silviana studied the young priest with interest. “You follow the old ways, Sister?”

“As best I can,” Marta replied quietly. “The Westport Temple still maintains some of the original practices, though we must be… discrete about it.” She glanced meaningfully at Aldric and Brother Castor. “I came here seeking guidance. If this man truly serves our goddess as the stories claim…”

“There’s a child in my party,” she continued, turning to Gond but clearly deferring to Silviana’s judgment. “Born with a withered leg, useless since birth. Lore-keeper, would you counsel me to ask for healing? Is this the test that would reveal truth?”

Gond felt the divine power stirring in response to the challenge, but also something else—a sense that this moment would define everything that came after. Not just his relationship with the established religious orders, but the future of everything he’d built.

“Bring her forward,” he said.

The child proved to be perhaps eight years old, her left leg twisted and malformed from birth. Helped by her mother and a walking stick, she approached with the careful dignity of someone who’d learned to live with disability, her eyes bright with curiosity rather than hope.

Gond knelt before her, placing his hands gently on her shoulders. “What’s your name?”

“Lily,” she said simply.

“Lily, I’m going to try to help your leg. It might feel strange, but it won’t hurt. Is that all right?”

She nodded solemnly, and Gond placed his hands on her withered limb. The familiar warmth of divine power flowed through him, seeking out the malformed bones and twisted muscles. But this wasn’t like healing a wound or curing a disease—this was reshaping something that had been wrong from birth, rewriting the very structure of her body.

The effort was enormous, drawing on reserves of divine energy Gond hadn’t known he possessed. Around him, he could hear gasps of amazement as Lily’s leg began to change, bones straightening, muscles filling out, skin taking on healthy color.

When it was finished, the child flexed her knee experimentally, her mouth falling open in silent wonder as she realized she could move it freely for the first time in her life.

“Thank you,” she whispered, then ran back to Sister Marta with tears of joy streaming down her face.

The circle was silent for a long moment, the implications of what they’d witnessed settling over everyone present. Finally, Sister Marta spoke.

“I’ve seen enough,” she said quietly. “This man carries divine blessing, whatever the politics of the situation might be.”

“One miracle proves nothing,” Aldric said, but his voice lacked its earlier conviction.

“Nothing at all\!” Brother Castor chimed in desperately, though his voice wavered. “Tricks and illusions\! The High Cleric is right to be skeptical\!”

“It proves everything,” Korgan replied firmly. “Divine power doesn’t flow to the unworthy, regardless of what titles they claim or what authorities recognize them.”

As the debate resumed, Gond found himself thinking about the choice before him. He could submit to the established orders, accept their oversight and limitations in exchange for official recognition. Or he could reject their authority entirely, accepting the consequences that would follow.

But as he looked around at the faces of his people—refugees who’d found hope, slaves who’d found freedom, fighters who’d found a cause worth dying for—he realized the choice had already been made.

“High Cleric Aldric,” he said, rising to his feet. “I thank you for your offer, but I must decline.”

Aldric’s face darkened, his mouth twisting into a scowl. “You refuse to submit to proper religious authority?”

“I refuse to submit to authority that serves politics rather than divine will,” Gond replied. “I refuse to accept oversight from those who’ve forgotten what it means to serve the oppressed.”

“Then you condemn yourself and all who follow you,” Aldric said, standing as well. “The Council of Sacred Orders will declare you heretical. Your movement will be outlawed. Your followers will be excommunicated.”

“So be it,” Gond said simply.

As the official delegation prepared to depart, their mission clearly failed, Sister Marta approached Silviana and Gond quietly.

“Lore-keeper,” she said, her voice filled with quiet determination. “I have learned much today. The old ways… they are not dead, are they? There are still those who remember Alanyi’s true calling.”

Silviana smiled gently. “The old ways endure, Sister. They wait for those with courage to embrace them again.”

Marta turned to Gond. “You know what this means,” she said quietly. “Open war with the established religious hierarchy. They’ll use every tool at their disposal to destroy you.”

“I know,” Gond replied. “But some things are worth fighting for.”

She studied his face for a long moment, then nodded slowly. “The Westport Temple still maintains the old practices in secret. We will remember what we witnessed here today—not just the healing, but the return of Alanyi’s true servant. When the time comes to choose sides, we’ll know where we stand.”

As the various delegations departed—some in anger, others in thoughtful silence—Gond found himself standing with his core allies around the dying fire. The weight of what had just transpired settled over them like a heavy cloak.

“Well,” Thorek said finally, “that could have gone better.”

“Could have gone worse, too,” Pell observed. “At least now we know where everyone stands.”

“Do we?” Silviana asked. “The religious orders are clearly divided. Some will support the established hierarchy, others will question it. The real test will come when they’re forced to choose between political expedience and divine truth.”

Gond nodded, feeling the weight of leadership settling heavier on his shoulders. The legend of the healer in the hills was truly ending now, replaced by something far more complex and dangerous—a movement that challenged not just the slave trade, but the entire structure of religious and political authority.

“What happens now?” Sim asked quietly.

Gond looked around at the faces of his friends and allies, seeing determination mixed with apprehension. They’d crossed a line today, one that couldn’t be uncrossed. The path ahead would be harder than anything they’d faced before.

“Now,” he said, “we prepare for war. Not just against slavers and their allies, but against everyone who profits from the current system. It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick. But it’s necessary.”

As the council dispersed and people returned to their various duties, Gond remained by the fire, staring into the flames and thinking about the future. This part of his journey was ending—the next part had become something else entirely.

What came next would test everything he’d learned, everything he’d built, and everyone who’d chosen to stand with him. But for the first time since accepting his calling, Gond felt truly ready for whatever lay ahead.

That night, as the settlement settled into its routines, Gond found himself walking the perimeter with Pell, checking the watch posts and thinking about the day’s events.

“Any regrets?” the thief asked as they paused at the eastern lookout.

Gond considered the question seriously. “About refusing Aldric’s offer? No. About what it means for everyone who follows me? That’s harder to answer.”

“They chose to be here,” Pell pointed out. “Just like you chose to heal instead of hide, they chose to stand instead of run. Whatever comes next, it’s their choice as much as yours.”

“Is it? Or are they just following where I lead, trusting that I know what I’m doing?”

Pell was quiet for a moment, studying Gond’s profile in the moonlight. “You know what the difference is between you and every other leader I’ve known?”

“What?”

“You actually care about the answer to that question.” The thief’s smile was barely visible in the darkness. “Most leaders assume they know what’s best for everyone. You worry about whether you’re worthy of the trust people place in you. That’s what makes you worth following.”

As they completed their circuit and returned to the settlement’s heart, Gond felt some of the weight on his shoulders ease. The path ahead was uncertain, the challenges enormous, the stakes higher than ever before. But he wasn’t walking it alone.

   
 

# **Chapter 18: First Stand**

The messenger stumbled into the valley at midday, his horse lathered with sweat and foam. Pell caught the man as he slid from the saddle, legs buckling beneath him.  
“Three columns—coming from the east,” the scout gasped, clutching Pell’s arm. “Maybe two hundred men. They march in perfect formation—evenly spaced, no stragglers or wanderers. These aren’t slavers grabbing easy prey.”

Gond emerged from the council tent, Thorek and Elena flanking him. The dwarf’s hand rested on his warhammer, while Elena’s fingers drummed against her sword hilt.

“How far?” Gond asked.

“Half a day’s march—they’ll be here by evening.” The messenger’s eyes darted around the bustling settlement. “They must have bypassed our outer patrols or moved with incredible speed through the rough country. They’ve got siege ladders. Crossbow companies. This isn’t a raid—it’s an assault.”

Thorek spat into the dirt. “About time. Been wondering when they’d stop sending amateurs.”

Elena studied the eastern ridge line. “Two hundred professional soldiers. That’s a significant investment. Someone wants you badly enough to hire an army.”

Gond’s jaw tightened. The settlement had grown to nearly three hundred souls, but barely half were fighters. The rest were refugees, children, elderly—people who’d come seeking sanctuary, not war.

“Grimjaw\!” he called.

The massive dwarf emerged from behind one of his siege engines, bronze-reinforced and gleaming in the morning light. Gold teeth flashed in his beard as he grinned. “Aye, lad? Time to test the old girl?”

“Three columns—coming from the east. Can your engines cover the eastern approach?”

Grimjaw’s grin widened. “Cover it? I can turn it into a fiery graveyard. Just give me targets.”

Thorek nodded approvingly. “The engines are positioned well. Overlapping fields of fire with the crossbow positions. But two hundred soldiers…” He stroked his braided beard. “We’ll need every advantage.”

Elena pointed to the settlement’s layout. “They’ll expect desperate refugees hiding behind makeshift walls. Instead, they’ll find prepared positions and coordinated defense.”

Gond surveyed his people as they began their preparations. Sim moved among the fighters, checking wounds from previous skirmishes. Silviana stood near the ancient oak, her hands pressed against its bark, lips moving in silent prayer. Alia and Dax helped distribute bolts and arrows, their faces grim but determined.

“Pell, take twenty of our best and position them in the rocks above the eastern pass. Let the first column through, then hit them from behind.”

Pell nodded, already selecting his team with quick gestures.

“Elena, coordinate the crossbow companies. Staggered volleys, maximum disruption.”

“Understood.”

“Thorek, you and I will hold the center with the main force. When they commit to the assault, we counterattack.”

The dwarf’s eyes gleamed. “Like the old days, when Turin and Alanyi fought side by side.”

Heat bloomed beneath Gond’s ribs, slowly spreading outward through his veins. His fingertips tingled as divine power stirred in response to the coming battle. “Let’s hope we’re worthy of that legacy.”

The enemy appeared at the ridge line just as the sun began dipping behind the western hills, their armor glinting in the late evening sun. Three columns, just as the scout had reported, moving with the disciplined precision of professional soldiers. No banners, no identifying marks—mercenaries hired for a specific job.

Gond crouched behind the settlement’s reinforced palisade, watching through a gap between logs. The lead column carried siege ladders and grappling hooks. The second bristled with crossbows. The third held back in reserve, their captain scanning the valley with a spyglass.

“Smart,” Elena murmured beside him. “They’re not underestimating us.”

The enemy captain lowered his spyglass and raised his hand. Horns sounded across the valley, their notes echoing off the surrounding hills.

“Here they come,” Thorek growled.

The first column advanced down the slope, shields locked, ladders ready. Behind them, crossbowmen took position on the ridge, their weapons trained on the settlement’s walls.

Gond waited until the attackers reached the valley floor. “Grimjaw\! Give them a welcome\!”

The siege engines’ massive frames groaned as the windlasses released. Throwing arms snapped forward with a sound like thunder, counterweight stones plummeting in their mesh of chains. A rain of small boulders, soaked in pitch and set alight, crashed into the center of the advancing column. Bodies fell under the onslaught, and burning pitch splashed in a large radius. The neat formation dissolved into chaos.

“Again\!” Grimjaw roared, his crews already cranking the windlass systems, their muscles straining against the massive mechanisms.

The second volley scattered the crossbowmen on the ridge. The third punched through the enemy’s shield wall, leaving a gap filled with screaming wounded.

But the professionals adapted quickly. The remaining soldiers spread out, using the terrain for cover. Crossbow bolts began raining down on the settlement, forcing defenders to duck behind their walls.

“They’re flanking left\!” Elena called out.

A group of soldiers had broken away from the main assault, moving toward the settlement’s weakest point. Gond saw their plan—pin the defenders with frontal assault while a strike team breached the walls.

“Silviana\!” he shouted.

The elf appeared at his side, her eyes bright with power. “I see them.”

She raised her hands, and the very air seemed to shimmer. The flanking soldiers stumbled, their formation wavering as confusion took hold. Some turned back toward their own lines, others stood frozen in place.

“Elven magic,” Thorek muttered appreciatively. “Haven’t seen that in decades.”

But the enemy captain was no fool. He’d held his reserve for exactly this moment. Fresh soldiers poured down the slope, overwhelming Pell’s position in the rocks. Gond watched his friend’s team fall back, fighting desperately against superior numbers.

“They’re breaking through\!” someone shouted.

The settlement’s eastern wall shuddered under the impact of grappling hooks and ladders. Defenders rushed to meet the assault, but the enemy had momentum now.

The warmth in Gond’s chest suddenly blazed like a forge fire, power coursing through his muscles until they hummed with divine strength. His sword erupted in silver light as he vaulted into a charge.

“For freedom\!” he roared.

The cry was taken up by every throat in the settlement. Thorek’s warhammer sang through the air, crushing skulls and shattering shields. Elena’s blade danced like quicksilver, finding gaps in armor with surgical precision.

But it was Gond who turned the tide. Divine power flowed through him like molten gold, enhancing his speed, his strength, his awareness. He moved through the enemy ranks with fluid grace, his blazing sword cutting down anyone who stood against him. Each strike flowed into the next, his feet finding perfect footing on treacherous ground while his blade danced between opponents.

A crossbow bolt took him in the shoulder, spinning him around. Another grazed his thigh. But the wounds closed almost as quickly as they opened, divine healing knitting flesh and bone.

The enemy soldiers began to falter. They’d come expecting to fight desperate refugees, not a paladin of Alanyi backed by dwarven siege engines and elven magic.

“Fall back\!” their captain shouted. “Regroup on the ridge\!”

But Gond wasn’t finished. He pressed the attack, leading his fighters up the slope in a devastating countercharge. The enemy broke and ran, leaving their dead scattered across the valley floor.

The morning sun was climbing by the time they finished counting the cost. Forty-three enemy dead, the rest fled into the hills. But victory had come at a price.

Gond knelt beside Orif’s body, the young man’s face peaceful in death. A spear had taken him through the heart during the final charge. Beside him lay Olega, an elderly woman who’d joined them only weeks ago. A crossbow bolt had ended her life as she tried to shield the children.

Seven dead. Nineteen wounded. The settlement had defended itself from its biggest attack yet, but the price was written in blood and tears.

“They fought well,” Thorek said quietly. “Died with honor.”

Sim moved among the wounded, his hands glowing with gentle light as he channeled Alanyi’s healing power. But even divine magic couldn’t bring back the dead.

Silviana approached, her face grave. “The enemy will return. This was a test, nothing more.”

Elena nodded. “They’ll report our capabilities, our numbers. Next time they’ll come with more soldiers, better tactics.”

Gond stood slowly, his shoulder still aching despite the healing. “Then we’d better be ready.”

He looked around at his people—human, dwarf, and elf standing together in the gathering darkness. They’d faced the first real test of their alliance and emerged victorious, but the cost had been higher than he’d hoped.

“We’ll honor our dead,” he said, his voice carrying across the settlement. “And we’ll remember why they died. Not for conquest or glory, but for the simple right to be free.”

Pell limped up beside him, a bandage wrapped around his head. “You know this won’t be the last attack.”

“Good,” Gond replied. “Let them come. We’ll be ready.”

But as he watched the funeral pyres being lit, he wondered how many more would die before their war was won. The path to freedom was paved with sacrifice, and he was beginning to understand the true weight of leadership.

The divine power still hummed in his veins, but it felt different now—heavier, more solemn. With each life lost, each victory won, he was becoming something more than just a reluctant paladin.

He was becoming a leader worthy of the cause he served.

Later that night, as the settlement settled into uneasy sleep, Gond stood watch on the eastern wall. The enemy dead had been stripped of weapons and armor, their bodies left for the carrion birds. It was harsh, but they couldn’t spare the effort to bury soldiers who’d come to enslave them.

Thorek joined him, the dwarf’s armor still stained with blood.

“First big battle’s always the hardest,” the war-priest said. “You did well, lad. Your people fought like lions.”

“Seven dead,” Gond replied. “Seven people who trusted me to keep them safe.”

“Aye. And how many more would have died if you’d done nothing? How many slaves would still be in chains?” Thorek’s voice was gentle but firm. “Leadership means making hard choices. The dead knew the risks.”

Gond nodded, but the weight in his chest didn’t ease. “The enemy captain was good. Professional. This wasn’t some slaver raid—someone hired real soldiers.”

“Your little rebellion is becoming a real threat.” Thorek grinned fiercely. “About time.”

A commotion near the settlement’s center drew their attention. Maera was approaching with a small group of riders, their horses steaming in the cool night air.

“More refugees?” Gond asked.

“No,” Thorek said, studying the newcomers. “Those are soldiers. Look at how they sit their horses, how they scan for threats.”

Gond climbed down from the wall, Thorek beside him. As they approached the group, he could see the dwarf was right. These weren’t desperate refugees—they were fighters, and well-equipped ones at that.

The lead rider dismounted, removing his helm to reveal a weathered face and graying hair. His armor bore the crossed hammers of Turin’s order, but with subtle differences that marked him as Iron Covenant.

“Battlemaster Korgan Ironshield,” the dwarf announced formally. “I bring word from the Iron Covenant’s high council.”

Thorek stepped forward, offering a warrior’s salute. “Brother. What news?”

Korgan’s expression was grim. “The slave cities have formed an alliance. Five major ports, pooling their resources. They’re raising an army—not mercenaries this time—but their own soldiers. Professional troops with siege engines and cavalry.”

Gond felt his stomach tighten. “How many?”

“Two thousand men, maybe more. They’ll march within the month.”

The number hung in the air like a death sentence. Two thousand professional soldiers against their three hundred fighters, half of whom were barely trained refugees.

“There’s more,” Korgan continued. “The religious orders are splitting. Some support you, others call you a heretic. It’s chaos in the temples.”

Silviana emerged from the shadows, her elven features sharp in the moonlight. “The Circle of Whispers has been watching these developments. We may have allies you don’t expect.”

“Elves?” Gond asked.

“Among others. The old alliances are stirring, the bonds forged when Turin and Alanyi first stood together against darkness.” Her eyes met his. “But it will take time to organize such support.”

“Time we may not have,” Elena said, joining the group. “Two thousand soldiers could be here in a month.”

Gond looked around at the faces surrounding him—dwarf, elf, and human united in common cause. The settlement’s first victory had proven they could fight, but the real war was just beginning.

“Then we’ll bring the fight to them,” Gond said, his voice carrying an authority that seemed to come from somewhere beyond himself. The words flowed with divine certainty, each syllable ringing with conviction. “We’ll strike their column on the move and annihilate them before they can reach the valley.”

That was not what Gond had planned to say. His own surprise was mirrored in the faces around him, but Gond had learned not to question when his goddess chose to speak through him.

“Until now we’ve been waiting for them to attack us. We’ve hit caravans and supply chains, but now it’s time to take the fight to the slavers. We’ll catch them off guard.”

The others stared at him with expressions caught between awe and reverence, their eyes reflecting something in him that he could not feel himself. Then Silviana gave a little shake of her head, nodded slowly, and started discussing the new plans with Thorek and the others. This seemed to break the spell, and everyone started to move with renewed purpose.

As the group dispersed to spread the word, Gond remained standing in the settlement’s center. The funeral pyres had burned down to glowing embers, but their light still flickered in the darkness.

Seven dead today. How many more before this was over?

But as he looked around at the settlement—at the workshops where weapons were forged, the training grounds where refugees learned to fight, the council area where former slaves planned their own liberation—he felt something he hadn’t expected.

Hope.

They’d faced professional soldiers and won. They’d proven that free people fighting for their homes could stand against any army. And now, with allies gathering from across the continent, they might actually have a chance.

   
 

# **Chapter 19: The Tide Turns**

The war council had been in session for three days, and the maps spread across the long table bore the scars of heated debate—ink stains, torn edges, and the circular marks left by countless mugs of bitter ale. Gond stood at the head of the table, his silver-white sword resting against his chair. The weapon hummed with barely contained energy, responding to the tension that filled the room like smoke from a poorly tended fire.  
“Two thousand, three hundred, give or take a few stragglers,” Pell said, tapping the map. He placed a series of small wooden tokens on the map, each representing enemy formations. “Got about two hundred horses on the flanks. Six big siege engines, maybe more, right down the middle. And these are pros, Gond, not the usual dirt-scratchers we’ve been hitting.”

Thorek Ironheart leaned forward, his braided beard clicking softly as the metal rings struck the table’s edge. “They’re moving slow. Those engines are slowing them down, forcing them to stick to the main roads.” His thick finger traced the enemy’s projected route. “Here, through Millhaven Pass. It’s the only way to get those machines through the mountains.”

Elena Brightblade studied the terrain with a tactician’s eye, her weathered hands mapping elevations and chokepoints. “The pass is narrow—maybe fifty yards at its widest point. Steep walls on both sides, loose scree that would make climbing difficult.” She looked up, meeting Gond’s gaze. “It’s perfect for an ambush, but only if we can get our forces in position without being detected.”

“My beauties ain’t exactly mountain goats,” Grimjaw rumbled, his gold-capped teeth glinting. “But I can strip ’em down. Smaller bits, easier to haul. Won’t get the same reach, sure, but in a tight spot like this pass? Range won’t matter. It’s all about putting the hurt where it counts.”

Silviana Starweaver sat with her hands folded, her ancient eyes reflecting depths of knowledge that spanned centuries. “The elven paths through the high country could move small groups undetected. My people know ways through the mountains that haven’t been used by human feet in generations.” Her voice carried the musical cadence of her race, but underneath lay steel.

“We can position archers on the heights with Grimjaw’s engines,” said Gond. “Rain death from above while our main force strikes from the front and rear, bottling them in the pass.”

Maera spread intelligence reports across an empty section of the table, her network’s careful observations laid out in neat rows. “My people in Millhaven say the enemy vanguard hits town tomorrow night. They’re demanding food, grabbing guides, and threatening to torch the place if folks don’t cooperate.” Her expression went grim. “And they’re asking about our valley. Asking about *you*, Gond.”

A chill settled over the council. Gond felt that familiar hum of power in his chest, but it wasn’t just a shield this time. It was cold, sharp, like a blade being drawn.

“How long?” he asked, his voice quiet.

“If they maintain their current pace, they’ll reach the valley in a week,” Pell replied. “But that assumes they don’t encounter any… obstacles along the way.”

Gond’s smile was sharp as a blade’s edge. “Then we’d better make sure they do.”

The preparations began before dawn, with Pell’s scouts melting into the pre-dawn darkness like shadows given purpose. They carried with them detailed maps of Millhaven Pass, marking every boulder that could provide cover, every ledge that could hold an archer, every weakness in the rocky walls that could be exploited. Behind them came the main force, moving in small groups to avoid detection, their gear muffled and their weapons wrapped in cloth to prevent telltale glints of metal.

Grimjaw’s engineers worked with the focused intensity of master craftsmen, breaking down their massive siege engines into components that could be pulled by teams of oxen. The bronze-reinforced frames were disassembled into sections, the torsion springs carefully wrapped and protected, the throwing arms secured with leather straps. What had been instruments of defensive warfare were being transformed into tools of ambush, their destructive power concentrated into portable packages of death.

Thorek led his dwarven warriors up the mountain paths, their heavy armor replaced with lighter mail that wouldn’t ring against stone. Each dwarf carried a crossbow in addition to their traditional weapons, and their movements spoke of warriors who had fought in mountain passes before. They knew how to use terrain as a weapon, how to turn stone and gravity into allies.

Elena coordinated the human fighters, organizing them into strike teams that could move independently but fight as a coordinated whole. Former slaves who had learned the art of war stood alongside veteran soldiers who had abandoned corrupt masters, their shared purpose binding them more tightly than any oath of allegiance. They carried grappling hooks and climbing gear, prepared to scale the pass walls if the battle demanded it.

Silviana led a small group of elven archers along paths that seemed to exist more in memory than reality, their feet finding purchase on ledges that human eyes could barely see. They moved with the fluid grace of their race, carrying longbows of yew and ash that could drive arrows through mail at distances that would make human archers weep with envy. Their quivers held arrows with heads designed for different purposes—bodkins for armor, broadheads for flesh, and a few special shafts with tips that gleamed with more than mere steel.

Gond himself moved between the groups, checking preparations and offering words of encouragement. But those who looked closely could see something different in his bearing—a confidence that went beyond mere tactical planning. His hand rested easily on his sword’s hilt, and the weapon’s faint luminescence seemed to pulse from within its sheath. Divine power flowed through him like a river finding its course, no longer the uncertain trickle of his early days but a steady current of purpose and strength.

Five days later, the last of the ambush force reached their positions. Millhaven Pass stretched below them like a stone corridor, its walls rising nearly two hundred feet on either side. The road that wound through its length was barely wide enough for two wagons to pass, and the loose scree on the slopes would make any attempt to climb treacherous at best. It was, as Elena had observed, perfect for an ambush.

Now all they had to do was wait.

The enemy vanguard appeared at the pass entrance as the afternoon sun began its descent. Fifty cavalry rode in loose formation, their horses picking their way carefully over the rocky ground. Behind them came the scouts on foot, eyes scanning the heights for any sign of danger. They moved with the caution of professionals who understood that mountain passes were natural killing grounds, but their very caution worked against them—they were looking for obvious threats, not for the carefully concealed positions that Gond’s forces had spent days preparing.

Gond crouched behind a boulder the size of a small house, positioned where he could see the entire length of the pass. Beside him, Thorek held a crossbow loaded with a bolt that would signal the beginning of the attack. The dwarf’s breathing was steady and controlled, his eyes fixed on the enemy column with the patience of a hunter waiting for the perfect shot.

“First group’s through,” Pell’s voice whispered from a speaking stone, one of Silviana’s elven innovations that allowed communication across distances. “Main column’s entering the pass now.”

Gond peered around the boulder’s edge and felt his breath catch. The intelligence reports hadn’t done justice to the sheer size of the enemy force. The column stretched back beyond the pass entrance, a river of steel and leather that seemed to flow endlessly between the stone walls. Siege engines rolled on massive wheels, their throwing arms reaching toward the sky like the limbs of mechanical giants. Infantry marched in disciplined ranks, their spears creating a forest of steel points that caught the afternoon light. Cavalry rode on the flanks, their horses snorting and stamping in the confined space.

“Grimjaw,” Gond whispered into his own speaking stone. “You ready?”

“Been ready since before you were born, lad,” came the gravelly chuckle. “Just say when.”

Gond watched as more of the column entered the pass. The enemy commander was being cautious, sending his forces through in manageable groups rather than risking the entire army in the narrow confines at once. It was smart tactics, but it also meant that Gond’s forces would face smaller numbers in each engagement.

The main body of the enemy army was now fully committed to the pass, their siege engines rumbling over the rocky ground with sounds like distant thunder. Officers rode up and down the column, shouting orders and maintaining formation. The professional discipline was impressive, but it also made them predictable.

“Elena,” Gond spoke into the stone. “Crossbows ready?”

“Loaded and aimed,” came the crisp reply. “Waiting for your signal.”

“Silviana?”

“The heights are ours,” the elf’s musical voice carried clearly through the stone. “My archers have clear shots at their officers.”

Gond felt the divine power surge within him, responding to the moment of decision. His sword’s luminescence brightened, casting silver light across the boulder’s surface. The warmth in his chest spread outward, filling his limbs with strength and his mind with clarity. This was the moment that would determine the fate of everyone who had chosen to follow him, everyone who had placed their trust in his leadership.

“For freedom,” he whispered, then raised his voice to carry across the pass. “Now\!”

Thorek’s crossbow sang, its bolt taking an enemy officer from his saddle. The signal was taken up by every hidden position, and suddenly the pass erupted in controlled chaos.

Pell’s team at the mouth of the pass leveraged huge boulders, loosened from the sockets. These fell into the pass, precipitating a rockslide the blocked retreat for the majority of the army that had already entered.

Grimjaw’s modified engines spoke next, their smaller frames compensating for reduced range with increased accuracy. Bolts the size of spear shafts punched through armor and flesh, while clay pots filled with alchemical fire shattered against stone and metal, spreading flames that clung like liquid death. The narrow confines of the pass turned the siege engines’ fire into a concentrated barrage that no formation could withstand.

Elena’s crossbowmen opened fire from concealed positions along the pass walls, their bolts raining down on the packed enemy ranks. The professional soldiers tried to raise shields, but the angle of fire made defense nearly impossible. Men fell screaming, their blood staining the rocky ground.

Silviana’s elven archers added their voices to the deadly chorus, their longbows sending arrows with surgical precision into the enemy ranks. Officers toppled from their horses, sergeants collapsed while shouting orders, and the careful discipline of the professional army began to fray under the relentless pressure.

But the enemy was not helpless. Their own crossbowmen returned fire, forcing Gond’s fighters to duck behind cover. Cavalry charged toward the pass walls, trying to reach positions where they could climb to the heights. The siege engines, those that hadn’t been destroyed in the initial barrage, began to return fire, their massive bolts shattering stone and sending deadly fragments flying in all directions.

It was then that Gond made his move.

He vaulted over the boulder that had concealed him, his sword blazing with silver-white light that seemed to burn away the shadows of the pass. Divine power flowed through him like molten gold, enhancing his speed and strength until he moved with inhuman grace. His feet found purchase on the treacherous scree as if the mountain itself was guiding his steps.

“For Alanyi\!” he bellowed, the sound raw and powerful, cutting through the battle’s roar. “For freedom\!”

The cry echoed back from his fighters, a wave of sound and fury. Thorek’s dwarves poured down from the heights, their war hammers and axes gleaming in the afternoon sun. Elena’s fighters emerged from concealment, their swords and spears ready for close combat. Even Silviana’s elves descended from their lofty perches, drawing curved blades that sang through the air with deadly precision.

The enemy tried to form defensive lines, but the narrow confines of the pass worked against them. Their superior numbers became a liability as soldiers pressed against each other, unable to maneuver or bring their weapons to bear effectively. The careful formations that had made them so formidable in open battle became death traps in the rocky corridor.

Gond cut through the enemy ranks like a force of nature, his divine sword cleaving through armor and bone with equal ease. Where he passed, enemy soldiers fell back in terror, their professional discipline crumbling before the sight of a paladin in full divine fury. His blade left trails of silver light in the air, and each strike seemed to carry the weight of divine judgment.

An enemy captain, his armor bearing the crossed manacles of the Slavers’ Guild, charged at Gond with a two-handed sword raised high. The man was skilled, his movements speaking of years of training and battlefield experience. But skill meant nothing against divine power. Gond’s blade met the captain’s sword in a shower of sparks, and the enemy weapon shattered like glass. A return stroke opened the man’s throat, and he fell without a sound.

Around him, the battle raged with increasing intensity. Thorek’s hammer crushed skulls and shattered shields, the dwarf’s battle cries echoing off the pass walls. Elena moved like a dancer, her blade finding gaps in armor with surgical precision. Grimjaw’s engines continued their deadly work, each shot carefully aimed to maximize destruction in the packed enemy ranks.

But it was the sight of Gond himself that truly broke the enemy’s will. Here was a figure from legend made manifest, a paladin of the old stories wielding divine power against those who would enslave the innocent. His sword blazed like a star fallen to earth, and his presence on the battlefield seemed to inspire his followers while striking terror into his enemies.

The enemy commander, a grizzled veteran with scars that spoke of a dozen campaigns, tried to rally his men for a counterattack. He rode through the chaos on a destrier that snorted and stamped, its hooves striking sparks from the stone. His voice carried over the din, calling for his soldiers to remember their oaths and their pay.

But even as he shouted, an elven arrow took him through the throat. He toppled from his saddle, and with his fall, the last organized resistance crumbled.

What followed was not a battle but a rout. The professional army that had marched so confidently into the pass broke and ran, their discipline shattered by the ferocity of the ambush and the terror inspired by Gond’s divine presence. Some tried to surrender, throwing down their weapons and calling for mercy. Others fought to the end, selling their lives dearly in the rocky confines of the pass.

But most tried to flee, abandoning their siege engines and supplies in their haste to escape the killing ground. Some managed to break through Gond’s forces at the opposite end of the pass, and streamed into the hills beyond. But the majority tried to retreat back through the mouth of the pass. When they found the exit from the pass blocked, they kneeled in surrender, cowering.

The sun was setting by the time the last echoes of battle faded from Millhaven Pass. The rocky ground was littered with the detritus of war—broken weapons, abandoned armor, and the still forms of those who would never see another dawn. The air was thick with the smell of blood and smoke, and the cries of the wounded echoed off the stone walls.

Gond stood in the center of the carnage, his sword’s light dimmed to a faint glow. Divine power still flowed through him, but the blazing intensity of battle had faded to a steady warmth in his chest. Around him, his fighters moved through the aftermath, tending to their own wounded and securing prisoners from among the enemy survivors.

The cost had been lighter than he had dared hope. Eighteen dead from his own forces, with perhaps twice that number wounded. Against an enemy army of over two thousand, it was a victory beyond his most optimistic projections. But each fallen fighter represented a life cut short, a family that would mourn, a future that would never be realized.

Thorek approached, his armor stained with blood and his hammer still dripping. “It’s done, lad. The ones that ran won’t stop until they reach the coast, and those that stayed…” He gestured toward the prisoners being gathered under guard. “Well, they’ll have some thinking to do about their choice of employers.”

Elena emerged from the shadows, her practical armor showing the marks of close combat. “We’ve secured their siege engines—six of the big ones, plus enough crossbows and spears to outfit a small army. Their supply train was carrying enough food to feed our settlement for months.”

Grimjaw’s laughter boomed across the pass as he examined the captured siege engines with professional interest. “Look at these beauties\! Dwarven-made, every one of them, but sold to the highest bidder without thought for how they’d be used. Well, they’re in proper hands now.”

Silviana descended from the heights with her elven archers, their movements as graceful as if they were walking through a forest glade rather than a battlefield. “The enemy’s retreat is complete,” she reported. “My scouts report scattered groups fleeing south, but no organized resistance remains.”

Maera appeared from wherever she had been observing the battle, her network’s intelligence having proved invaluable in the victory. “Word of this will spread faster than wildfire,” she said, her voice carrying satisfaction. “Every slaver from here to the southern kingdoms will know that the Paladin of Alanyi is not to be trifled with.”

Gond nodded, but his attention was focused on the broader implications of their victory. The Slavers’ Alliance had committed their main field army to this attack, confident that their superior numbers and professional training would be enough to crush the rebellion in its cradle. Instead, that army had been shattered, its remnants scattered to the winds.

“This changes things,” Gond said, his voice still rough from the battle but clear enough to carry. “Their main army’s broken. The slaver cities? They’re vulnerable now. They’ve got their town guards, sure, maybe some hired muscle. But nothin’ like *this*.” He gestured to the carnage.

Thorek’s grin was all teeth. “Aye. And now we’ve got their big smashers to knock on their pretty gates.”

Elena nodded, already calculating. “Saltmere, Blackwater, Port Sorrow… their armies were their shield. Without them…”

“Without ’em, they’re just rats in a trap,” Gond finished, his voice hard. “Now those are cities we can crack open. People we can free. This whole rotten business? We end it.”

The divine power stirred within him again, responding to the vision of liberation that stretched out before them. For months, they had been fighting a defensive war, reacting to enemy moves and trying to protect what they had built. But this victory had changed the strategic balance completely.

Now they could go on the offensive.

Pell materialized from the shadows, his thief’s instincts having kept him alive through another battle. “So what’s the plan, then? March on the cities while they’re still reeling from this defeat?”

Gond looked around at the faces of his commanders, seeing the same realization dawning in their eyes. The tide of the war had indeed turned, but not in the way any of them had expected. Instead of a desperate defense of their valley sanctuary, they now had the opportunity to strike at the very heart of the slave trade.

“Back to the valley,” he said, the decision settling in his voice. “See to our wounded. Honor our dead. Then we plan. These cities, they’ve dug in deep over the years. Won’t be a quick kick in the door.” A grim smile touched his lips. “But they *will* fall. After today, that’s not a hope. It’s a promise.”

As his forces began the long march back to their valley home, Gond remained for a moment longer in the pass. The setting sun painted the stone walls red as blood, and the shadows stretched long across the battlefield. Somewhere in the distance, a carrion bird called, its cry echoing off the rocks.

The mercenary who had been betrayed and sold into slavery was truly gone now, replaced by something harder and more purposeful. The reluctant leader who had stumbled into divine power had evolved into a paladin worthy of the title. And the defensive war that had begun with desperate refugees hiding in a mountain valley had transformed into something far greater—a campaign of liberation that would reshape the continent.

The tide had turned, and nothing would ever be the same.

   
 

# **Chapter 20: The Price of War**

The air in the council chamber was thick enough to spread on hardtack, a blend of woodsmoke, old parchment, and the distinct aroma of simmering dwarven frustration. Maps lay unfurled across the long table, weighted down with daggers and whetstones, depicting the Slavers’ Coast and the fortified cities that were their ultimate targets. Gond, seated at the head, let his gaze drift over the faces assembled. Each bore the marks of the coming conflict in their own way.  
“A direct assault on Saltmere is madness,” Thorek Ironheart rumbled, his fist a heavy punctuation mark on the map, perilously close to a spilled inkwell. “But a feint, drawing their main force, while Grimjaw’s beauties crack open their western gate? That has the ring of proper dwarven strategy.” His beard, braided with iron rings, bristled with conviction. “Strike hard, strike fast. Justice demands no less.”

Sim, his weathered hands resting calmly in his lap, offered a counterpoint as gentle as falling leaves. “And what of the innocents within, Thorek? The slaves, the conscripts, those caught in the gears of this war? Alanyi teaches that the path to true victory is paved with mercy, not just might. Can we not offer terms? A chance for surrender before the hammers fall?”

Grimjaw Ironforge, whose own hands looked capable of bending iron bars, let out a snort that sounded like a bellows deflating. “Mercy? Tell that to the ghosts in the slave pits, priest. Some rats need drowning, not a life raft.” His gold-capped teeth flashed. “We hit them where they live, break their will to fight. That’s the only mercy slavers understand.”

Elena Brightblade, her practical armor a stark contrast to Silviana’s flowing robes, tapped a slender finger on a coastal fortress. “Philosophical differences aside, our immediate concern is logistics. Saltmere has a deep-water harbor. Taking it cripples their supply lines from the southern kingdoms. But their fleet is formidable. How do we neutralize it without a navy of our own?”

“The elven fleets of old faced similar challenges,” Silviana Starweaver murmured, her voice like the rustle of ancient leaves. Her eyes, pools of forest shadow, held the wisdom of centuries. “Deception, coastal raids to draw out their patrols, using the very currents against them. The sea can be a fickle ally, or a devastating foe.”

Maera raised her sharp gaze. “My network reports unrest in the guilds of Blackwater. The war taxes are heavy, and the flow of ‘goods’ has been… disrupted.” A faint smile touched her lips. “A well-placed spark there could ignite a fire that consumes them from within.”

Pell, lounging in a corner with the deceptive ease of a coiled viper, finally spoke, his voice dry. “Sparks are good. But don’t forget who we’re fighting. Some are fanatics, true believers in the Slavers’ Guild. Some are just hired swords, loyal to the highest bidder. And a whole lot are conscripts who’d rather be anywhere else. Knowing who’s who tells you where to push, and where to offer a golden bridge for retreat.”

Gond listened, a faint smile playing on his lips. The tension was still present, a live current beneath the surface, but it was the tension of a coiled spring, not a fraying rope. He let the debate flow, guiding it with a quiet question here, a nod of encouragement there. The grimness that had clung to him for so long was receding, replaced by a weary but resolute confidence. The brand on his forehead, once a burning symbol of shame, was now a faded tracery, almost lost in the lines of thought and care.

“So,” Gond said, his voice cutting through a renewed surge of debate between Thorek and Sim. It wasn’t loud, but it carried a weight that drew all eyes. “We agree the serpent has many heads. Thorek, your desire for a decisive blow is sound. Grimjaw, your urgency is felt by us all. Sim, your call for mercy is the bedrock of what we build. Elena, your pragmatism keeps us grounded. Silviana, your wisdom offers paths we might not see. Maera, Pell, your insights into the enemy’s heart are invaluable.”

He leaned forward, his gaze sweeping the council. “We will not choose one path, but many. We will be the hammer, and the subtle current. The open hand, and the hidden blade. We fight not just to win, but to build something worthy of the sacrifices this war will demand.”

A commotion from the courtyard interrupted him—the unmistakable clatter of armored men and horses. Gond rose, his hand resting lightly on the hilt of his sword. “Expecting company, Elena?”

Elena was already at the window. “Noble Knights, by the look of their banners. Sir Roderick Ashford leads them.”

Thorek grunted. “Come to tell us how to fight our war, have they?”

Gond’s smile was wry. “Perhaps. Or perhaps they’ve merely come to observe the ‘rabble’ in action. Let us extend our hospitality.”

Sir Roderick Ashford, his polished armor gleaming, dismounted with the practiced ease of a man to whom command was a birthright. Six knights, equally well-equipped, formed a respectful but wary semi-circle behind him.

“Gond of the Valley,” Sir Roderick announced, his voice clear and carrying. “We request an audience.”

“Granted, Sir Roderick,” Gond replied, his tone even, a hint of his old sardonic humor lacing his words. “It’s not every day our humble war council is graced by such distinguished guests.”

The knight’s answering smile was thin, his eyes assessing. “Your ‘humble’ efforts have caused considerable stir in less humble circles. May we speak in private? Our discussion touches on matters of… delicate alliance.”

Gond led Sir Roderick to a smaller chamber, Thorek and Elena taking positions near the door, a silent testament to their own authority. Silviana, a shadow in her forest-hued robes, settled into a quiet corner, her presence a subtle weight in the room.

“You speak of alliance,” Gond began, gesturing for the knight to be seated. “Yet your order, as I understand it, remains loyal to crowns that profit from the very trade we seek to end.”

Sir Roderick met his gaze directly. “There are many within the Noble Knights, myself among them, who find the stain of slavery intolerable. We believe it dishonors our vows to Turin, and shames our houses.” He leaned forward, his voice dropping. “We wish to see it ended. And we believe a coordinated effort is the swiftest path.”

“A laudable goal,” Gond conceded. “What form of coordination do you envision?”

“We have resources,” Roderick stated. “Wealth, influence, access to intelligence within the courts and merchant houses. We can disrupt their finances, sow discord among their leadership, even provide arms and training to those who rise against them. In return…”

“Ah,” Gond said softly. “The inevitable return.”

“In return,” Roderick continued, a hint of steel entering his voice, “we expect that when the dust settles, a proper order is established. One that recognizes the natural hierarchy. Those of noble birth and proven leadership guiding the realm, ensuring stability and justice for all, including the freedmen. Freedom, after all, must not beget chaos.”

Gond felt a familiar weariness, but pushed it down. This was not a man to be baited into anger. “And who determines this ‘proper order,’ Sir Roderick? And this ‘natural hierarchy’?”

“History determines it. Breeding. Education. The capacity to govern is not found in every field hand or dock worker, however much we may pity their former plight.” Roderick’s certainty was absolute, the conviction of generations.

Gond nodded slowly. “I see. You would break their chains, only to fit them with a different sort of leash.” He paused, then continued, his voice calm, almost gentle. “In our valley, Sir Roderick, former field hands now forge weapons. Former quarry slaves now learn siege craft from dwarven masters. Women who were once property now command troops and debate strategy. We find leadership in the most unexpected places, once the opportunity is given.”

As Gond spoke, his conviction infusing his words, Silviana’s eyes narrowed slightly. Sim, who had quietly entered and stood near the doorway, drew a soft breath. For a fleeting instant, to them, the faded slave brand on Gond’s brow seemed to shimmer, the intertwined manacles resolving into two luminous, intertwined circles of silver light – the symbol of Alanyi. Then it was gone, leaving only the faint scar. Gond himself felt nothing—no warmth, no tingling, no divine presence stirring within him. The power remained dormant, waiting.

Roderick shifted, his posture straightening as his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. His fingers drummed once against his thigh before he caught himself and stilled them. “A charming experiment in idealism. But a nation cannot be run by a council of… equals. Someone must lead. Someone must make the hard decisions.”

“We make them together,” Gond said simply. “Human, dwarf, elf. Noble-born and common-born. It is not always easy. It is often loud.” A ghost of a smile. “But the decisions are ours, forged in shared purpose, not imposed by birthright.” He leaned forward, his gaze holding Roderick’s. “We are not seeking to reform the old system, Sir Knight. We are building something entirely new.”

Roderick was silent for a long moment, his eyes studying Gond’s face as if searching for cracks in his resolve. “You speak of revolution,” he said at last, his voice flat.

“We speak of freedom,” Gond corrected gently. “True freedom. For everyone.”

The knight rose, his hand falling to the pommel of his sword. “Then our paths, it seems, diverge more sharply than I had hoped.” He looked at Gond, his brow furrowing slightly as his mouth pressed into a thin line—disapproval warring with something that might have been reluctant admiration. “You are a compelling speaker—and a dangerous idealist.”

“Perhaps,” Gond allowed. “But we intend to change our ideals into realities.”

Roderick gave a curt nod. “When your war efforts align with objectives that serve the greater good of ending this vile trade – objectives we can support without endorsing your… social experiment – my people may offer aid. Intelligence, perhaps, or action against mutual foes. But we will not fuel a fire that consumes the very foundations of order.” He turned to leave. “A word of advice. Such radical equality breeds its own resentments. Be wary of those closest to you.”

“Thank you for the counsel, Sir Roderick,” Gond said. “And for the offer of conditional aid. We will welcome any genuine effort to end slavery, from whatever quarter it may come.”

After the knights had departed, their shining armor receding into the afternoon sun, Pell slipped into the chamber. He carried a small, surprisingly heavy pouch, his fingers working it with the practiced ease of someone who understood the weight and feel of different coins.

“One of Roderick’s men,” Pell said, his voice carefully neutral as he tossed the pouch onto the table. It landed with a dull clink of gold. “A squire, name of Alaric. Seems he thought my loyalties might be… negotiable.”

Gond raised an eyebrow. “And are they?”

Pell grinned, a flash of his old self. “Everything has a price, as they say. He offered this for a bit of information. Troop numbers, defensive plans, any juicy disagreements in the council. Seemed to think Sir Roderick might find it useful for his ‘conditional aid’.”

Elena picked up the pouch, weighing it with the practiced assessment of someone who’d handled many such transactions. Her eyebrows rose slightly at the heft. “Generous.”

“Indeed,” Gond mused. He looked at Pell. “And what did you tell this enterprising young squire?”

“I told him I’d consider his most generous offer,” Pell said, his eyes glinting with mischief. “And that I’d need a bit more upfront to ensure my… discretion.” He produced another, smaller pouch from within his cloak, letting it drop beside the first with a satisfying chink. “He was quite accommodating.”

Thorek chuckled, a sound like rocks tumbling. “A thief to the end, eh lad?”

“Resourceful,” Pell corrected smoothly. He met Gond’s gaze. “The gold is yours, of course. Or rather, ours. But the offer… it made me think. If Sir Roderick is looking for information…”

Silviana spoke, her voice thoughtful. “An open channel, even one bought with coin, can be a conduit for truth as well as deception. Or, perhaps, for a carefully curated version of the truth.”

Gond nodded slowly, a plan forming in his mind. “Indeed. Sir Roderick wishes to make ‘informed decisions.’ Perhaps we can help inform him. Pell, my friend, it seems your talents for negotiation are about to be put to a new and fascinating use.”

The council reconvened, the maps now bearing new marks, new possibilities. The encounter with Roderick, and Pell’s subsequent revelation, had added another layer of complexity to their already daunting task.

“So, we feed this Alaric just enough to keep Roderick interested,” Elena summarized, “and perhaps steer his ‘conditional aid’ in directions that benefit us most. Risky. But potentially very useful.”

“The greatest risks often yield the greatest rewards,” Sim said, his gaze on Gond. “If the information is chosen with wisdom, it can be a tool for peace, even in wartime.”

Gond looked at the faces around him – dwarf and elf, human and former slave, warrior and healer and strategist. Each unique, each vital. “We are walking a knife’s edge,” he said. “Enemies before us, uncertain allies at our flank. But we walk it together.”

His gaze drifted to the window, where the valley was alive with the work of a people building their own future. “Sir Roderick spoke of the world’s realities. He’s not wrong. But realities can be reshaped. Ideals can be given form and strength. What we build here, what we fight for… this is not just a dream. It is the shape of the world to come, if we have the courage to make it so.”

A messenger, breathless and dust-covered, was shown into the chamber, bearing dispatches. Gond took them, his expression sobering as he read.

“The Slavers’ Alliance has mustered,” he announced, his voice quiet but carrying to every corner of the room. “They’ve fortified their major cities. And…” He paused, a different light in his eyes. “And word from Maera’s network. Uprisings in three more provinces. Temples openly declaring for our cause. Even some younger nobles are renouncing their titles and riding to join us.”

He looked up, meeting their gazes one by one. “The war is upon us. In all its fury, and all its hope.”

   
 

# **Chapter 21: Revelation and Ripples**

The messenger arrived at dawn, his horse foam-flecked and trembling with exhaustion. Gond met him at the settlement’s gates, already knowing the news would be significant—no one rode that hard for trivial matters.  
“From the capital,” the man gasped, sliding from his saddle. “The High Temple has issued a proclamation.”

Gond helped steady the messenger, noting the man’s travel-stained robes marked him as a temple courier. “What kind of proclamation?”

“About you.” The messenger’s eyes were wide with shock, his mouth working soundlessly for a moment before words emerged. “They’ve declared you either the greatest saint in a century or the most dangerous heretic since the Sundering Wars.”

Gond’s lips thinned. Another bloody complication. “And the temples are offering a consensus on which I am?” he asked, his voice dry.

“Both, it seems. The temples are splitting down the middle.”

Within the hour, the council chamber was packed with representatives from every faction in the settlement. The messenger, fortified with hot food and strong ale, spread his dispatches across the table like a merchant displaying wares.

“The Temple of Alanyi in Westport has declared you a true paladin,” he reported, reading from one scroll. “They cite the healing miracles and the liberation of the oppressed as proof of divine favor.”

“And the opposition?” Elena asked.

“The High Temple in the capital calls you a pretender using stolen magic for political gain. They’ve issued writs of excommunication and branded your followers as heretics.”

Sim’s face had gone pale, the color draining from his cheeks as his hands trembled slightly in his lap. “Excommunication? But that means—”

“It means nothing,” Thorek interrupted gruffly. “The Iron Covenant learned long ago that corrupt priests don’t speak for the gods.”

“Easy for you to say,” Sim replied, his voice barely above a whisper. “You have your own religious authority. I’m a priest of Alanyi, sworn to obey the established order.”

“Are you?” Silviana asked quietly. “Or are you a servant of the goddess herself?”

The question hung in the air like incense. It was the heart of the religious crisis spreading across the continent—did divine authority flow through established institutions, or directly from the gods to their chosen servants?

“There’s more,” the messenger continued. “The Circle of Whispers has called for a formal conclave. They want to examine your claims personally.”

Gond felt his stomach tighten. The Circle of Whispers was the highest authority among the elves, a council of ancient beings who remembered the world before human kingdoms. Their judgment would carry weight far beyond their own people.

“When?” Silviana asked.

“As soon as may be, at the Grove of First Light. They’ve requested that Gond appear before them to answer for his actions.”

“And there’s one more thing,” the messenger added, consulting another scroll. “A delegation from Millhaven arrived yesterday, seeking audience. They claim to represent the merchant guilds.”

Gond’s expression didn’t change, but a new alertness entered his eyes. “Millhaven, you say? And they arrived *yesterday*?” The timing was suspect to say the least. “Something about them troubles you. What did you feel?”

“Nothing I can put my finger on, my Lord… just a feeling. They’re too smooth, their eyes too quick.”

“But you have concerns about them,” Gond stated, his gaze steady on the messenger.

“Well it ain’t for me to say I figure, but they don’t behave like any priests of Kemiss I’ve seen before.”

Silviana’s eyes sharpened. “Priests of Kemiss? Here?”

“They’re waiting in the guest quarters,” the messenger confirmed. “Said they’d wait as long as necessary to speak with you.”

Thorek’s hand moved to his warhammer. “Could be a trap.”

Gond’s gaze sharpened. Priests who didn’t act like priests, arriving just as the world was tilting on its axis. Coincidence was a luxury he rarely encountered. “An opportunity, perhaps,” Gond said, his voice measured. “Or a different kind of test. We’ll see what these ‘merchants’ want. Then we address the Circle.”

The delegation from Millhaven waited in the settlement’s guest quarters, a modest building that had once housed refugees but now served for diplomatic meetings. As Gond approached with Thorek, Elena, and Silviana flanking him, he observed the two men through the open doorway before entering. The messenger’s unease had been contagious.

They wore the robes of Kemiss priests—rich blue fabric with golden thread depicting scales and coins. Yet, their stillness was that of predators, not priests. Their eyes, when they flickered towards the sound of approach, held a flat, assessing quality. Gond noted the way their hands rested, not in pious contemplation, but as if ready to move with speed. Beneath the embroidered symbols of commerce, he caught the faint, unsettling shimmer of other markings, like heat haze over dark water.

“Greetings,” said the elder of the two as Gond and his retinue entered. The man rose with a fluid motion that belied his thin frame. His smile was a carefully constructed artifice. “I am Brother Aldwin, and this is Brother Cassius. We represent the merchant guilds of Millhaven.”

“An honor you have traveled so far to speak with us,” Gond said, his tone neutral as he took a seat. He gestured for his companions. “Millhaven’s guilds have not typically concerned themselves with settlements such as ours. What ‘opportunities’ bring you here now?” His gaze was direct, missing nothing of their subtle reactions.

“Trade opportunities,” Aldwin replied smoothly. “Your… liberation activities have disrupted certain supply chains. We’re here to discuss alternative arrangements that might benefit all parties.”

The air in the room seemed to thicken, carrying an acrid scent like burning weeds. Gond felt the divine power stirring uneasily in his chest, like a warning bell. There was something fundamentally wrong about these men, something that made his paladin senses recoil.

“What kind of arrangements?” Elena asked.

“Practical ones,” Cassius spoke for the first time, his voice carrying an odd resonance. “The slave trade serves important economic functions. Perhaps we could find ways to… reform it rather than destroy it entirely.”

“Reform slavery?” Thorek’s hand moved to his warhammer. “That’s like reforming murder.”

“Now, now,” Aldwin said, raising his hands in a placating gesture. “We understand your moral concerns. But consider the economic realities. Sudden liberation creates chaos, unemployment, social upheaval. Surely a gradual transition would be more humane?”

As he spoke, Gond felt something else—a creeping sensation of fear trying to worm its way into his mind. Not natural fear, but something imposed from outside, like invisible fingers pressing against his thoughts.

“You’re not priests of Kemiss,” Silviana said suddenly, her elven senses apparently detecting the same wrongness.

The two men’s facades cracked slightly. Aldwin’s smile became predatory, while something flickered in Cassius’s eyes that wasn’t entirely human.

“Perceptive,” Aldwin said. “But then, we expected no less from the so-called paladin’s advisors.”

The fear effect intensified, washing over the room like a tide. Gond saw Elena’s hand freeze halfway to her sword, her face draining of color as her pupils dilated with unnatural terror. Thorek stood motionless, his weathered features pale and his breathing shallow. Even Silviana seemed caught in the spell’s grip, her usual composure cracking as her hands trembled against her staff.

But Gond felt the divine power surge in response, burning away the imposed fear like sunlight through fog. More than that—he sensed the true nature of the men before him. Not merchants, not even priests of Kemiss, but something far darker.

“Gorlatch,” he said, the name coming to him with divine certainty, along with a clear call to action.

Both men hissed, their human masks slipping further. “The Forbidden God has many servants,” Cassius snarled. “More than you know. We have worked for centuries to build what you seek to destroy.”

“The slave trade,” Gond realized. “It was never just about profit. It was about corruption, about weakening Alanyi’s influence.”

“Finally, he understands,” Aldwin laughed, a sound like a mail fist dragged across glass. “Every chain forged, every auction blessed, every temple that turned from mercy to commerce—all part of the great work. The waning of the light, the triumph of profitable darkness.”

“And your companions are helpless to aid you,” laughed Cassius. “They are frozen by the sending of our Master.” Cassius’ eyes had turned completely black. “And even a paladin can’t stand against two high priests of Gorlatch\!”

The fear spell pulsed stronger, but Gond drew his sword. The silver blade blazed with blue-white light, and suddenly his companions could move again. Elena’s blade cleared its sheath, Thorek raised his warhammer, and Silviana began weaving protective magic.

“Impossible,” Cassius breathed, staring at the glowing blade. “No mortal weapon should be able to cut through our power.”

“Good thing it’s not mortal,” Gond replied, advancing on them.

The false priests shed their human forms entirely, revealing themselves as creatures of shadow and malice. They struck with claws of darkness and voices that spoke words in no earthly language.

But Gond’s sword cut through their attacks like they were made of mist. Each stroke of the divine blade sent waves of courage through his allies, dispelling the lingering effects of the fear magic. Elena’s blade found its mark, Thorek’s hammer crushed shadow-stuff, and Silviana’s magic bound the creatures in place.

In moments, it was over. The clerics of Gorlatch dissolved into wisps of darkness, their dying screams echoing with promises of vengeance.

“Well,” Pell said from the doorway, where he’d arrived just in time to see the end of the fight. “That was educational.”

Gond sheathed his sword, feeling the divine light fade but not disappear entirely. “Now we know what we’re really fighting. Not just slavery, but the corruption behind it. Gorlatch’s influence, working through false priests and corrupted institutions.”

“The pieces fit,” Silviana said thoughtfully. “The timing of the slave trade’s expansion, the corruption of the religious orders, the way commerce became more sacred than compassion. It’s all connected.”

“Then we know what we have to do,” Thorek said grimly. “Root out the corruption wherever we find it. No more half-measures.”

As they left the guest quarters, Gond felt the weight of revelation settling on his shoulders. The enemy was larger and more insidious than they’d imagined. But they’d also proven something important—his divine power could cut through even ancient evil.

Later examination by Gond found that the rest of the delegation were ordinary merchants who knew nothing of their leaders’ true form. Gond permitted them to leave in peace, telling them to spread the word that the days of Gorlatch’s influence were ending.

The next afternoon, the council met again to discuss the request from the elves.

“Requested?” Pell snorted as they returned to the council chamber. “The Circle of Whispers sounds more like a summons.”

“It is both,” Silviana said carefully. “The Circle doesn’t command, but their invitations are rarely refused.”

Thorek stroked his braided beard. “What’s their interest in this? The elves have stayed out of human affairs for centuries.”

“Because these aren’t just human affairs anymore,” Silviana replied. “Gond’s actions affect the balance of power across all races. If he’s truly Alanyi’s chosen, it changes everything.”

“And if he’s not?” Maera asked.

“Then we’re all following a very charismatic madman into a war we can’t win.”

The blunt assessment sent a chill through the chamber. For all their victories, all their growth, everything they’d built rested on the assumption that Gond was what they believed him to be—a paladin blessed by divine power.

“I’ll go,” Gond said quietly.

“Absolutely not,” Elena protested. “It could be a trap. The Circle might be neutral, but they have their own agenda.”

“What choice do I have? If I refuse, it confirms their suspicions. If I go and fail their tests…” He shrugged. “At least we’ll know where we stand.”

“You won’t go alone,” Thorek declared. “The Iron Covenant has as much right to witness this as anyone.”

“As do the humans,” Maera added. “This affects all of us.”

Silviana nodded slowly. “The Circle will allow a small delegation. But the final judgment will be theirs alone.”

The Grove of First Light lay three days’ ride to the north, hidden deep in the ancient forest that had stood since before the first human kingdoms. As Gond’s small party approached the sacred site, the very air seemed to thicken with age and power.

Ancient oaks towered overhead, their trunks so massive that a dozen men couldn’t encircle them with joined hands. Shafts of golden sunlight filtered through the canopy, creating pools of light that seemed to pulse with their own rhythm. The silence was profound, broken only by the whisper of wind through leaves and the distant sound of running water.

“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Pell whispered.

“Few humans have,” Silviana replied. “This grove was old when your ancestors were still learning to work iron.”

At the heart of the grove stood a circle of standing stones, each one carved with symbols that seemed to shift and flow in the changing light. Between the stones sat seven figures, so still they might have been carved from the same ancient rock.

The Circle of Whispers.

Gond had expected elves, but these beings transcended such simple categories. They were tall and graceful, yes, but there was something otherworldly about them—as if they existed partially in this realm and partially in some other, more fundamental reality.

The eldest, a figure whose hair was white as starlight and whose eyes held the depth of centuries, rose from her stone seat.

“Gond of the Valley,” she said, her voice carrying the music of wind through leaves. “I am Aelindra, Speaker for the Circle. You have claimed divine authority. To claim such authority falsely carries grave consequences. How do you answer?”

“I claim nothing,” Gond replied, his voice steady as he stepped forward. He met Aelindra’s ancient gaze without flinching. “I am what Alanyi, or fate, or sheer bloody-mindedness has made me. If your Circle deems that ‘divine authority,’ that is your word for it. I call it a heavy load and a path I walk because I must.”

A subtle murmur, like the rustling of ancient leaves, passed through the Circle. Aelindra’s lips curved slightly.

“An interesting answer,” Aelindra mused. “Most who stand before us, touched by power, are eager to proclaim their divine mandate. You sound like a man sentenced to a duty he cannot escape.”

“That’s a fair assessment,” Gond said with a wry twist of his lips. “I didn’t seek this. I was a mercenary, content with my coin and my anonymity. This path chose me, through fire and chains. Responsibility, as it turns out, is a stubborn master.”

Another member of the Circle, a male elf with silver hair and eyes like deep forest pools, leaned forward. “Yet you wield power that could only come from divine blessing. We have felt it from here—the healing light—the righteous fury, the touch of something beyond mortal ken.”

“I do what needs doing. I accept Alanyi’s power with gratitude, for our need is great. If this makes me a paladin, then so be it. If not…” Gond shrugged. “I’ll use it to free slaves and protect the innocent either way.”

“Even if it damns your soul?” asked a third member, her voice sharp as winter wind.

“My soul was probably damned long before I became a paladin. I was a mercenary, remember? Killed for coin, served whoever paid best. If Alanyi can find some use for a man like that, who am I to argue?”

The Circle exchanged glances, something transcending speech seemed to be communicated between them. Finally, Aelindra spoke again.

“We would test your power. Not to judge its source, but to understand its nature.”

“What kind of test?”

“Healing. There is one among us who bears an ancient wound, inflicted in the wars against the Shadow. If your power is truly divine, it will respond to genuine need.”

A fourth member of the Circle rose, and Gond saw why they’d chosen this test. The elf’s left arm was withered, the flesh blackened as if by some terrible fire. But this wasn’t ordinary damage—there was something fundamentally wrong with the limb, as if it existed partially outside normal reality.

“Shadow-touched,” Silviana whispered. “Such wounds resist all healing, magical or divine.”

“Can you help him?” Aelindra asked.

Gond approached the wounded elf, studying the damaged arm. He could feel something emanating from it—a cold, hungry darkness that seemed to devour light itself. This wasn’t a wound that could be healed with bandages or herbs. It was a spiritual injury, a tear in the very fabric of existence.

Gond sensed the fundamental evil in the wound, and an answering call from inside himself.

“I don’t know,” he said honestly. “But I must try.”

He placed his hands on the elf’s shoulder, just above the shadow-touched flesh. Divine power stirred within him, but it felt different than usual—more cautious, as if it too recognized the danger.

The power flowed down his arms and into the wounded elf. For a moment, nothing happened. Then the blackened flesh began to writhe, the shadow-stuff recoiling from the divine light like a living thing.

The elf gasped, his eyes widening in pain and hope. The darkness fought back, sending tendrils of cold up Gond’s arms. He gritted his teeth and poured more power into the healing, feeling the divine light clash with primordial shadow.

For a heartbeat, the outcome hung in balance. Then the shadow shattered like glass, dissolving into wisps of nothingness. The elf’s arm blazed with golden light, flesh and bone reforming as if they’d never been damaged. As the light reached its zenith, a searing brilliance that forced many to shield their eyes, Silviana gasped, her gaze fixed on Gond’s brow. For an instant, superimposed over the faded slave brand, she saw two intertwined circles of pure, ethereal light—Alanyi’s sigil—burning with an impossible intensity before vanishing as swiftly as it appeared. The healed elf, blinking against the afterglow, stared in awe at Gond’s now-clear brow.

When the light faded, the arm was whole.

The Circle sat in stunned silence. Even Aelindra’s ancient composure had cracked, her eyes widening as her mouth fell slightly open, her hands gripping the arms of her stone seat. The other members leaned forward as one, their eternal stillness broken by this unprecedented moment.

“In three thousand years,” she whispered, “no power has been able to heal shadow-touch. Not elven magic, not dwarven runes, not even the high priests of the old gods.”

Gond stood silently, swaying slightly from the effort.

The healed elf flexed his restored arm, tears streaming down his face. “I had forgotten what it felt like to be whole. Thank you.”

Aelindra rose from her stone seat, and the other members of the Circle followed suit. As one, they bowed—not deeply, but with unmistakable respect.

“The Circle of Whispers recognizes Gond of the Valley as a true paladin of Alanyi,” she declared formally. “Let all who hear these words know that he acts with divine authority.”

“What does that mean, practically speaking?” Thorek asked.

“It means the elven nations will support his cause. It means our ancient treaties with the dwarves are renewed in common purpose. And it means the established human orders can no longer claim exclusive authority over divine matters.”

The implications left Gond stunned. This wasn’t just religious recognition—it was a political earthquake that would reshape the balance of power across the continent.

“There’s more,” Aelindra continued. “We offer you a gift, Paladin. Knowledge that may aid your cause.”

She gestured, and the air above the stone circle shimmered. Images formed in the light—maps, faces, symbols that seemed to burn themselves into Gond’s memory.

“The locations of the slave cities’ hidden assets. The names of their secret allies. The routes they use to move their most valuable cargo.” Her voice carried the weight of centuries. “Use this knowledge wisely.”

As the images faded, Gond felt the full weight of what had just occurred. The Circle of Whispers had just declared war on the established order, throwing their ancient authority behind a former slave and mercenary.

“Why?” he asked. “Why risk everything for someone like me?”

Aelindra’s smile was sad and beautiful. “Because someone like you is exactly what the world needs. The old ways are dying, Paladin. The question is whether something better will take their place.”

The journey back to the settlement passed in a silence thick with unspoken thoughts. Each member of the delegation grappled with the implications of what they had witnessed.

As they crested the final hill, the valley spread below them, a tapestry of new construction and cultivated land. Gond felt the familiar tug in his chest – not the ache of memory for a lost home, but the fierce protectiveness for this one, forged in shared struggle. The settlement hummed with a quiet energy, a stark contrast to the turmoil the Circle’s decision was about to unleash upon the wider world.

“So,” Pell said, breaking the silence as they neared the gates, his voice laced with its usual cynicism, though his eyes held a new respect. “Do we start polishing a throne, or is ‘Lord Paladin’ sufficient for now?”

Gond shot him a look that could curdle milk. “Call me ‘Your Holiness’ and Thorek gets to use you for target practice.”

The dwarf grinned, hefting his hammer. “Been a while since I tested my aim on a moving target.”

“He’s still the same stubborn ox who pulled you from that ship,” Elena commented, a rare smile touching her lips. “Divine recognition hasn’t changed that, thankfully.”

“Good,” Silviana said, her gaze sweeping over the welcoming faces gathering at the news of their return. “The world has enough self-important deities and their anointed. It needs leaders who remember the sting of the lash and the weight of chains.”

Gond dismounted, the weariness of the past days settling into his bones, yet a new resolve hardening his gaze. He saw Maera pushing through the crowd, her expression urgent.

“Word has been arriving all morning,” she said, her voice low. “From across the territories. It’s… chaotic.”

“Gather the council,” Gond said, his voice carrying over the murmurs of the crowd. “All of them. We have much to discuss, and little time.”

The council chamber buzzed with a nervous energy. Maps, newly annotated with the knowledge acquired from the Circle, lay spread across the main table. Maera’s scouts, dusty and grim-faced, stood ready to give their reports.

“From the Northern Passes,” one began, “three temples of Alanyi have declared for Gond. Their priests are now hunted by Royalist patrols. Lord Valerius of Stonebridge has mobilized his household guard, claiming to ‘restore order’.”

Pell, leaning against a wall, let out a dry chuckle. “My ‘noble’ contact in the capital sends his panicked regards. Says the King’s council is in an uproar. Half want to send an army to crush us, the other half want to send assassins to deal with Gond quietly. Apparently, ‘heretic’ and ‘saint’ are causing quite the theological headache.”

Elena, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword, pointed to a coastal region on one of the Circle’s maps. “And the Slaver cities? This intelligence suggests they’re pulling further into their cities. They know their secrets are compromised.”

Thorek slammed a mailed fist on the table. “Then let’s crush them now\! The Iron Covenant has waited centuries for a true reckoning.”

“This isn’t just about military might anymore, Thorek,” Silviana interjected, her voice calm amid the rising tension. “We’re fighting for the soul of civilization itself. The Circle’s recognition gives us legitimacy, but it also paints a larger target on our backs.”

Gond listened, his gaze moving from speaker to speaker, absorbing the fragmented reports, the fear, the anger, the determination. He stepped towards the table, his presence drawing all eyes. He spread his hands over the maps, a gesture that was both grounding and commanding.

“The Circle has given us a weapon sharper than any blade: truth,” he said, his voice calm but resonant, cutting through the chamber’s disquiet. “And with it, a responsibility that stretches far beyond this valley.” His eyes met Silviana’s. “Draft a proclamation. We offer sanctuary to all who renounce the corruption that has poisoned our lands, but swift justice to those who uphold it. Let it be carried by every wind, to every corner of this continent.”

He turned to Thorek. “Your warriors, and ours, will secure the Sunken Road. The Circle’s maps show it’s their main artery for gold and new slaves. We cut it, and we bleed them.”

His gaze found Elena and Maera. “Coordinate our raids. Use this new intelligence. We will continue to strike where they believe they are safest, where their corruption festers deepest. We will show them that their shadows cannot hide from Alanyi’s light, nor from the wrath of those they have wronged.”

A new energy filled the room, replacing the nervous uncertainty with focused resolve.

Outside, the sounds of the settlement continued – the ring of the smith’s hammer, now working on dwarven-designed spearheads alongside human apprentices; the shouts of children, now including young elves, playing near the newly dug irrigation channels; the murmur of voices as Sim, no longer just a healer but a spiritual guide to many, spoke to a mixed group of humans, dwarves, and even a few curious elves under the shade of the great oak. Refugees, once broken, now drilled with a fierce determination under Elena’s hardened soldiers, their wooden practice swords moving with a desperate hope. Pell was found later teaching a group of younger scouts how to read the complex elven maps, his cynical commentary punctuated by surprisingly patient instruction.

As dusk settled, Silviana found Gond atop the small rise overlooking the valley, the lights of the settlement twinkling like fallen stars.

“The ripples have become waves, Gond,” she said softly, joining him. “They will try to drown us.”

Gond watched a child, a former slave, hand a waterskin to a dwarven smith whose forge still glowed in the twilight. “Let them,” he replied, his voice quiet but unyielding. “We’ve learned to swim in deeper waters than they can imagine. And we’re not just fighting for ourselves anymore.”

PART V  
*The War for Freedom*  
   
 

# **Chapter 22: A House Divided**

The first defectors arrived at dawn—a column of twenty knights in travel-stained armor, their banners torn and their faces grim. At their head rode Sir Marcus Brightwater, a man Gond recognized from Elena’s intelligence reports as one of the Noble Knights’ most respected commanders.  
“Sir Roderick won’t be pleased,” Elena observed from the settlement’s walls.

“Sir Roderick can go hang himself,” Sir Marcus called out. “We’ve come to join the true fight.”

Gond met them in the settlement’s center, flanked by Thorek and Silviana. The contrast between this group and Sir Roderick’s delegation was stark—these knights looked like they’d been through hell, their expensive armor dented and bloodied.

“What happened?” Gond asked.

Sir Marcus dismounted heavily, his movements those of a man pushed beyond exhaustion. Fresh scars crisscrossed his knuckles, and a partially healed cut ran from his left temple to his jaw—the kind of wound that came from fighting someone you’d once called brother. “Civil war. The Noble Knights have split down the middle. Half still believe we can reform the system from within. The other half…” He gestured to his battered companions. “We’ve seen enough.”

“Seen enough of what?”

“The truth—three days ago, we raided a plantation outside Westmarch. Found children in the fields, some no older than eight. When we demanded their release, the overseer showed us a contract signed by Sir Roderick himself.”

The words hit like physical blows. Heat bloomed beneath Gond’s ribs, spreading outward through his chest like molten metal seeking release. His fingertips tingled with electric warmth, and for a moment, the air around him seemed to shimmer with barely visible light.

“Roderick’s been playing both sides,” Sir Marcus continued. “Talking about honor and reform while his family profits from child slavery. When we confronted him…” He touched a bandage on his forehead. “Let’s just say the discussion became heated.”

“So you left?”

“We were expelled—branded as traitors to the order and enemies of the crown.” Sir Marcus’s laugh was harsh. “Funny thing is, they were right. We are traitors—to a system that deserves to burn.”

Thorek stepped forward, studying the knights with professional interest. “How many more like you?”

“Maybe thirty, scattered across three kingdoms. The rest are either true believers in the old ways or too afraid to act.” Sir Marcus met Gond’s eyes. “We know we can’t undo what we’ve been part of. But we can try to make amends.”

“And what do you want from us?”

“A chance to fight for something worth dying for.”

The integration of the Noble Knight defectors proved more challenging than Gond had anticipated. Unlike the refugees and former slaves who’d joined them, these men came with ingrained assumptions about justice and divine purpose that needed careful reshaping.

“I don’t understand,” Sir Garrett Blackwood declared during his first council session. “We’re here to end slavery, to bring justice to the oppressed. Turin’s hammer should fall on these slavers like divine wrath.” As he spoke the last words, some in the council fancied they saw a flicker of silver light in his eyes, or heard the distant crackle of a storm, so fervent was his conviction. “Why all this talk of mercy and healing?”

Sim, seated quietly in the circle, spoke with gentle firmness. “Because justice without mercy becomes vengeance. And vengeance breeds only more suffering.”

“The priest speaks wisdom,” Thorek rumbled, though his own warrior’s instincts clearly favored the hammer approach. “But there’s a place for both. Turin’s strength to break the chains, Alanyi’s touch to heal what was broken.”

Sir Garrett’s brow furrowed. “Alanyi? But her temples are ruins. Her priests scattered or dead. Turin’s order dominates because his strength is what the world needs.”

“Does it?” Gond asked quietly. “Look around you, Sir Garrett. What do you see?”

The knight’s gaze swept the diverse gathering—former slaves working alongside dwarven smiths, elven advisors sharing ancient wisdom with human strategists, children who’d known only bondage now learning to read and fight.

“I see… cooperation,” Sir Garrett admitted reluctantly.

“You see healing,” Gond corrected. “You see what happens when mercy tempers justice, when strength serves compassion rather than domination.”

Similar conversations played out across the settlement as the new arrivals struggled to understand their place in something larger than simple retribution. Some adapted quickly, recognizing that their desire for justice could serve a greater purpose. Others wrestled with concepts that challenged everything they’d been taught about divine will and righteous warfare.

The evening council meeting was larger than usual, packed with representatives from every faction in their growing alliance. The diversity was remarkable—dwarven war-priests sat beside elven mages, reformed nobles debated strategy with former slaves, and the handful of Alanyi’s surviving priests huddled together like candle flames in a storm.

“The reports from the north are troubling,” Maera announced, spreading dispatches across the table. “Three more temples have declared for our cause, but they’re not the grand Turin sanctuaries we might expect. They’re forgotten shrines to Alanyi, hidden in ruins and backwater villages. Her priests are emerging from hiding, but they’re few and frightened.”

“Frightened of what?” Sir Marcus asked.

“Of being noticed,” Sim replied quietly. “For two centuries, Alanyi’s worship has been… discouraged. Not banned outright, but marginalized, forgotten, allowed to wither. Her temples fell into ruin while Turin’s grew grand and wealthy.”

Silviana’s gaze dropped to her hands, her fingers tracing the grain of the wooden table as if reading ancient stories in its surface. When she looked up again, moisture gathered at the corners of her eyes—the first crack in her elven composure that any of them had witnessed. “The elves remember when her light shone as bright as any god’s. When healing and joy were valued as highly as strength and justice.”

“What changed?” one of the newer knights asked.

“Gorlatch,” Thorek spat. “The corruption we’ve been fighting isn’t new. It’s been growing for centuries, turning strength into cruelty, justice into oppression. Easier to control people through fear than inspire them through hope.”

Gond felt the familiar stirring of divine power, but this time it was different—deeper, more profound. As he looked around at the faces watching him, he sensed something building, a moment of significance approaching like a gathering storm.

“We’re not just fighting slavers,” he said, his voice carrying clearly through the chamber. “We’re fighting for the soul of civilization itself. For the balance that’s been lost.”

As he spoke, his conviction grew, and with it, something else. The divine power that usually flowed through his hands during healing began to suffuse his entire being. His voice took on new resonance, carrying harmonics that seemed to touch something deep in every listener’s heart.

“For too long, strength has stood alone, untempered by compassion. Justice has become vengeance, order has become oppression. The light of mercy has dimmed to barely a flicker.”

The change was subtle at first—a deepening of his voice, a luminous quality to his words that made everyone lean forward. But then something extraordinary happened. Gond’s eyes widened slightly, as if he were hearing his own words for the first time, and when he spoke again, it was clear that another voice spoke through him.

“My children,” the voice said, and it was Gond’s throat that formed the words, but the presence behind them was unmistakably divine, ancient, and infinitely compassionate. “How long have you wandered in darkness, believing that strength alone could light your way?”

Silviana gasped, her elven senses immediately recognizing the divine presence. Her hands flew to her heart as if trying to contain something that threatened to burst free. Sim fell to his knees, tears streaming down his weathered face, his weathered hands pressed flat against the floor in reverent prostration. The dwarven representatives shifted forward as one, their beards bristling with sudden energy, while several reached instinctively for the holy symbols at their throats. Even the hardened knights felt something stir in their hearts—Sir Marcus’s scarred hands trembled as he gripped the table’s edge, his knuckles white with the effort of remaining upright. Former slaves throughout the chamber began to weep openly, their faces transformed by wonder and disbelief that such grace could touch their broken lives.

“I have not abandoned you,” Alanyi continued through Gond’s transformed voice. “Though my temples lie in ruins, though my priests hide in shadows, though the world has forgotten the sound of joyful laughter and the touch of gentle healing—I remain. In every act of mercy, in every moment of compassion, in every choice to heal rather than harm, I am there.”

The divine presence grew stronger, and those with spiritual sensitivity could see a faint glow surrounding Gond, as if he were lit from within by starlight.

“The balance must be restored. Turin’s strength is needed—his hammer to break the chains of oppression, his sword to defend the innocent. But strength without mercy becomes tyranny. Justice without compassion becomes cruelty—the world has learned this truth through centuries of suffering.”

Sir Marcus found himself weeping openly, his warrior’s pride crumbling before the overwhelming sense of divine love and sorrow.

“Rise, my faithful ones,” Alanyi’s voice commanded gently. “Reclaim what was lost. Rebuild what was broken. Let my light shine again in temples raised not to my glory, but to the healing of this wounded world. Let mercy temper justice, let compassion guide strength, let joy return to hearts that have known only fear.”

The presence began to fade, but the voice continued, growing softer but no less profound. “The path ahead is hard, my children. You will face those who profit from darkness—who have grown fat on suffering, who mistake cruelty for strength. But you do not walk alone. In every freed slave, in every healed wound, in every moment of hope kindled in despair—there I am with you.”

As the divine presence withdrew, Gond swayed slightly, his own consciousness returning fully. The chamber was silent except for the sound of quiet weeping and awed breathing.

“Did that really happen?” Sir Garrett whispered.

“Alanyi spoke,” Sim said, his voice thick with emotion. “After all these years of silence, she spoke.”

Gond looked around at the transformed faces surrounding him, feeling the weight of what had just occurred. The divine power still hummed in his veins, but it was his own voice when he spoke again.

“Now you understand,” he said quietly. “This isn’t about conquest or even justice alone. It’s about restoration. About bringing back the balance that was lost.”

In the profound silence that followed, Gond felt a clarity of purpose he’d never experienced before. The goddess had spoken through him, and her words had revealed the true scope of their mission.

“Sim,” he said, turning to the gentle priest who still knelt in reverent awe. “Rise, my friend. Alanyi has work for you.”

Sim stood slowly, his eyes bright with tears and wonder. “What would you have me do?”

“Lead her revival,” Gond said simply. “Not through force or compulsion—but through example. As we liberate lands, as we free people from bondage, create spaces where her worship can flourish again. Rebuild the ruined temples, train new priests, but always remember—we offer hope—we don’t demand faith.”

“I… I’m not worthy of such responsibility,” Sim protested.

“None of us are,” Gond replied with a slight smile. “But worthiness isn’t the point. Willingness is. Will you serve?”

Sim straightened, and for the first time since Gond had known him, the gentle priest looked like a leader. “I will.”

Silviana rose gracefully from her seat, her ancient eyes bright with purpose. “If I may,” she said, her musical voice carrying clearly through the chamber. “The elves remember much that has been forgotten. The old rites, the sacred songs, the ways of healing that go beyond the merely physical. I offer this knowledge to aid in Alanyi’s restoration.”

“You would help human priests?” Sir Marcus asked, surprised.

“I would help heal the world,” Silviana replied simply. “Divine truth transcends the boundaries of race. If Alanyi’s light is to shine again, it will need all the wisdom we can gather.”

Gond felt pieces falling into place, a grand design revealing itself. “Then we have our path. Three armies will march, but not just for military victory. We fight to reclaim lands where Alanyi’s temples can rise again. We fight to heal the spiritual wounds that Gorlatch’s corruption has inflicted. We fight to restore the balance between justice and mercy.”

“What of the slave cities?” Elena asked. “The practical concerns of war?”

“Still vital,” Gond assured her. “But now we understand why. Every slave market we close, every auction house we burn, every chain we break—it’s not just liberation, it’s purification. We’re cleansing the land of centuries of spiritual poison.”

Thorek hefted his warhammer, but his expression was thoughtful rather than merely warlike. “The Iron Covenant has preserved Turin’s true teachings for two centuries. We know that strength serves best when it protects rather than conquers. Our hammers will break the chains, but your healing will mend what was broken.”

“And the Noble Knights who remain loyal to the old ways?” Sir Marcus asked.

“They’ll have to choose,” Gond replied. “Stand with the corruption they’ve served, or embrace the restoration that’s coming. Some will see the truth, as you did. Others…” He shrugged. “Turin’s justice will find them eventually.”

The next few days passed in a whirlwind of preparation, but now every action carried deeper meaning. In the settlement’s makeshift temple, Sim worked alongside Silviana to consecrate weapons with ancient rites—swords gleamed with faint silver light after being anointed with blessed oils, and even the siege engines received ritual purification with sacred water drawn from the settlement’s deepest well. Maps were studied not just for tactical advantage, but for the locations of ruined temples that could be reclaimed. Messages flew between allied forces, carrying word of the divine mandate that now guided their cause.

The transformation in the settlement was remarkable. The Noble Knight defectors, who had arrived seeking simple justice, now spoke of restoration and healing with the fervor of converts. Former slaves who had fought for freedom now understood they were part of something greater—the return of hope itself to a world that had forgotten its meaning.

“It’s like watching a new religion being born,” Pell observed as he watched Sim leading a mixed group of humans, dwarves, and elves in evening prayers. “Though I suppose that’s exactly what it is.”

“Not new—reborn,” Gond corrected. “Alanyi’s worship is ancient, older than the kingdoms that tried to suppress it. We’re not creating something from nothing—we’re nurturing something that never truly died.”

“And you?” Pell asked. “How does it feel to be a prophet?”

Gond was quiet for a long moment, watching the diverse gathering that had become his responsibility. “Terrifying,” he admitted.

“Now you’re responsible for the spiritual welfare of an entire continent?”

“Something like that.” Gond’s smile was rueful. “Though I suppose I’m not doing it alone.”

Indeed, the burden was shared. Sim had thrown himself into his new role, his shoulders squared with newfound purpose as he worked late into each night by candlelight, carefully transcribing ancient texts with Silviana. His gentle hands moved with painstaking deliberation across parchment, each letter formed with the careful concentration of someone for whom writing was still a struggle. More often than not, Silviana would speak the ancient words aloud while Sim listened with closed eyes, committing them to memory rather than parchment—his faith had always been one of the heart rather than the written word. The elven lore-keeper proved invaluable, her ancient memory holding songs and ceremonies that had been lost to human knowledge for centuries.

The military preparations continued as well, but with new purpose. Elena coordinated with the elven forces, planning strikes that would not only disrupt the slave trade but also secure locations where Alanyi’s temples could be rebuilt. Thorek worked with his Iron Covenant allies to ensure their assault on the inland strongholds would leave room for healing and restoration rather than just destruction.

Even Maera’s intelligence network had taken on new significance. Her contacts weren’t just gathering military information—they were identifying hidden communities of Alanyi’s faithful, scattered priests who had maintained their devotion in secret, and potential allies who might be swayed by the promise of spiritual renewal.

The final council meeting before the campaign was held in the settlement’s largest hall, now packed beyond capacity with representatives from every faction in their alliance. But the atmosphere was different from previous gatherings—where once there had been grim determination, now there was something approaching joy.

“The northern force is ready,” reported Captain Lyralei, speaking for the elven contingent. “Five hundred warriors, supported by mages and scouts. We’ll strike at the supply routes through the Thornwood, but we’ll also secure the ruins of the Starlight Shrine. Our lore-keepers believe it can be restored.”

“The Iron Covenant stands prepared,” Thorek declared. “Two thousand hammers for the central cities, ready to break whatever walls stand in our way. And when those walls fall, we’ll help raise new ones—temples instead of slave pens—healing halls instead of auction houses.”

“And the coastal assault?” Elena asked.

Gond stood, feeling the weight of divine purpose settling on his shoulders like a mantle. “Fifteen hundred fighters, including our newest allies. We’ll hit three cities in rapid succession—Saltmere, Blackwater, and Port Sorrow. But we’re not just cutting off the head—we’re purifying the land itself.”

He moved to the great map that dominated one wall, pointing to the marked positions. “Each of these cities has ruins of Alanyi’s temples, buried under slave markets and counting houses. When we take them, we’ll tear down the monuments to greed and raise up sanctuaries of healing.”

“The risks are enormous,” Maera warned. “If any of the attacks fail, the entire war will be lost.”

“The risks of doing nothing are greater,” Gond replied. “Every day we wait, more souls are corrupted by Gorlatch’s influence. Every day we delay, the spiritual poison spreads deeper.”

He looked around the hall at the faces watching him—faces that represented every race, every class, every background imaginable. But now they were united by something more than shared struggle. They were bound together by shared purpose, by the divine mandate to heal a wounded world.

“This is our moment,” he continued, his voice carrying the authority that had grown within him since Alanyi’s manifestation. “Three armies, three objectives, one sacred mission—the restoration of balance to a world that has forgotten the meaning of mercy.”

“And after?” Sir Marcus asked. “What happens when the fighting’s done?”

Gond’s gaze swept across the assembled faces, seeing not just warriors and refugees, but the foundation of something unprecedented—a society built on the principle that strength should serve compassion, that justice should be tempered by mercy.

“After, we build,” he said simply. “Not just a nation, but a new way of living. Where Alanyi’s temples stand beside Turin’s halls, where healing is valued as highly as strength, where the strong protect the weak not because they must, but because they choose to.”

“A pretty dream,” someone called out. “But can it work on a large scale?”

“Look around you,” Gond replied. “Over a year ago, this settlement didn’t exist. A year ago, most of us were strangers, enemies, or slaves. Now we’re family, bound together by something stronger than blood or law—by the choice to serve something greater than ourselves.”

The hall erupted in cheers, but they were different from the war cries of previous gatherings. These were sounds of joy, of hope, of people who had found not just a cause worth fighting for, but a vision worth living for.

As the sound washed over him, Gond felt the divine presence stir within him again—not the overwhelming manifestation of Alanyi’s voice, but a gentle warmth that spoke of approval and blessing.

They were ready.

That night, as the settlement prepared for the sacred war to come, Gond walked among his people one last time. Tomorrow, many of them would march to battle. Some wouldn’t return. But tonight, there was only quiet determination and the bonds forged through shared purpose.

He paused at the workshop where Grimjaw was making final adjustments to his siege engines. The massive dwarf looked up from his work, gold teeth flashing in the lamplight.

“Ready for tomorrow, lad?”

“As ready as anyone can be for something like this.”

“Aye, well, that’s the thing about divine missions. Nobody’s ever really ready for them. They just happen when they need to happen.”

Gond nodded, watching the dwarf’s skilled hands work. “Any regrets? About leaving your old life behind?”

Grimjaw’s laugh was like distant thunder. “My old life was building weapons for kings who used them to keep slaves in chains. This?” He gestured to the engine that would soon be breaking down the walls of slave cities. “This is what I was meant to build. Tools for liberation, not oppression.”

As Gond continued his rounds, he found similar sentiments everywhere. Former slaves who’d found purpose in restoration. Former nobles who’d discovered honor in service to something greater than themselves. Priests who’d rediscovered their faith by serving the divine will rather than human politics.

The house of the old order was indeed divided, split between those who clung to corruption and those who embraced renewal. But from that division, something new was being born—not just a nation, but a new understanding of what civilization could be.

Tomorrow would bring the ultimate test. Three armies would march against an enemy that outnumbered them and outgunned them. The odds were long, the risks enormous.

But as Gond looked out over the settlement—at the workshops and training grounds, the council halls and healing centers, the small shrine where Sim led evening prayers for a mixed congregation of humans, dwarves, and elves—he felt no doubt.

   
 

# **Chapter 23: The First Tithe of Tears**

The war council tent, once a place of strained alliances and grudging compromise, now buzzed with purposeful activity—voices no longer carried the sharp edge of suspicion, hands no longer hovered near weapon hilts during debates, and the very air seemed charged with shared conviction. Woodsmoke and old parchment still scented the air, but beneath it lay the almost palpable thrum of shared conviction, a resonance that had settled over them since Alanyi’s voice had echoed through Gond. Maps of the Slavers’ Coast still dominated the tables, but now, beside the grim fortifications of Saltmere, Blackwater, and Port Sorrow, new symbols had appeared—faded markings indicating ruined shrines, forgotten holy wells, places where Alanyi’s light had once touched the land.  
Gond stood before them, not as a desperate leader running from one crisis to the next, but as an instrument honed and ready. The weariness was still etched around his eyes, but his gaze held a crystalline focus that seemed to pierce through surface concerns to the heart of each matter. His movements were economical yet fluid, each gesture deliberate, as if he could see the threads of fate weaving together before him. The faded brand on his forehead, once a source of shame, now seemed a mere shadow beneath the memory of divine light that many in this room had witnessed.

“Saltmere first,” Gond stated, his voice calm but carrying the weight of the goddess’s recent pronouncement. “Their harbor is deep, their slave pens overflowing. And,” he tapped a newly inked circle on the map, “Sim believes this was once the site of the Sunken Grotto, a major temple to Alanyi before the slavers desecrated it.”

Sim, his gentle face alight with a newfound, quiet authority, nodded. “The old texts are fragmented, but they speak of healing waters there, blessed by Alanyi’s tears. According to the Chronicle of Sorrows, the Grotto was where pilgrims came to be cleansed of their deepest wounds—not just of body, but of spirit. The waters were said to flow from a spring that touched the goddess’s own realm, carrying her compassion directly into our world. If we can reclaim it—” He trailed off, the unspoken hope filling the silence.

“Reclaiming it is not enough,” Silviana Starweaver added, her voice like the rustle of ancient leaves. “The corruption of Gorlatch runs deep in these places. The very stones will cry out. Purification rites will be needed, rites the elves remember, and which we will share with Sim’s new acolytes.” Her silver eyes met Gond’s. “The tunnels I spoke of beneath Blackwater? Similar passages exist beneath Saltmere, older still. My ancestors walked those paths when the world was younger—they were carved not by mortal hands—but by the roots of the World Tree itself, following ley lines of power that predate human civilization. They can grant us entry, not just to the city’s heart—but perhaps to the Grotto’s foundations with minimal destruction.”

Sir Marcus Brightwater, his armor still bearing the scars of his defection but his eyes now bright with a convert’s zeal, leaned forward. “Using tunnels means fewer lives lost on the walls, both ours and theirs. A merciful approach for a sacred task.” The transformation in the Noble Knight was remarkable; the man who had arrived seeking Turin’s hammer now spoke Alanyi’s language.

“Precisely,” Gond affirmed. “Our aim is not mere conquest, but a cleansing. We offer every soul in Saltmere a choice: renounce the darkness or be consumed by it. But the stones, the land itself, these we reclaim for the light.”

Elena Brightblade, ever the pragmatist, pointed to the wider map. “While we focus on Saltmere, what of the other fronts? The three prongs of our sacred campaign must strike in concert.”

A dusty dwarven messenger, newly arrived, stepped forward. “Lord Thorek Ironheart sends word from the Dragon’s Spine mountains, High Paladin.” The title, still new, resonated with respect. “His Iron Covenant warriors have engaged the slaver garrisons at Blackrock Pass. The fighting is fierce, but they have broken through the outer defenses. He says, and I quote, ‘We are not just smashing stone, we are carving out sanctuaries. Where their fortresses stood, Alanyi’s peace will find footing, and Turin’s true justice will guard it.’ They have already secured the old Pilgrim’s Rest shrine, long fallen to ruin, and dwarven masons are preparing to assist Sim’s people in its reconsecration when the time is right.”

A ripple of approval went through the council. Then, a slender elven scout, nearly invisible against the tent’s canvas, spoke. “Captain Lyralei of the Thornwood strike force reports success. The Gorlatch-blessed supply caravans moving south from the Shadowfen are in disarray. We have… discouraged their passage.” A faint, dangerous smile touched her lips. “Furthermore, our lore-keepers have located and begun the purification of three ancient elven way-shrines deep within the Thornwood, places where the natural harmony had been disrupted by Gorlatch’s encroaching shadow. The land itself breathes easier.”

Silviana nodded. “My kin understand that true war against such darkness is fought on many levels. While some elves engage in these necessary disruptions, my path as Alanyi’s priestess is to preserve and heal. The knowledge of the tunnels is part of that, a way to achieve our aims with less blood spilled.”

Gond absorbed the reports, a sense of interconnected purpose weaving through him. “Good. The pincers tighten, and the light spreads. Our assault on Saltmere will be the central blow. Elena, your forces will secure the tunnel entrance Silviana indicates. Grimjaw,” he turned to the massive dwarf, “your engines will create a diversion at the main gates, draw their eyes while our true strike slips in.”

Grimjaw’s gold-capped teeth flashed. “A bit of noise to consecrate the occasion? My beauties will sing a hymn of breaking stone they won’t soon forget\!”

The days that followed were a blur of preparation. In the settlement’s expanded training grounds, an extraordinary sight unfolded: dwarven battlemasters trained alongside human knights and elven rangers. In the forges, dwarven smiths taught their human counterparts, their hammers ringing in harmony. Sparks flew, not just from hammer on hot steel, but occasionally with a distinct silver crackle as weapons were quenched, imbued with Turin’s resilient strength, while Alanyi’s mercy seemed to settle like a warm, golden sheen on others. Elven fletchers taught former slaves the art of crafting arrows, their patient hands guiding rough fingers in the delicate work of balancing shaft and point. Weapons were not merely sharpened but blessed by Sim and his growing band of acolytes, human and even a few dwarven volunteers, all learning the nascent rites of a reborn faith under Silviana’s patient tutelage. Armor was mended with prayers for protection. The army, once a desperate band of survivors, now moved with the quiet dignity of a congregation preparing for high holy service.

Sir Marcus and his former Noble Knights, initially struggling with the shift from pure retribution to merciful restoration, found themselves instructing former slaves in the use of sword and shield, their lessons now laced with talk of protecting the innocent and upholding Alanyi’s grace. The irony was not lost on them, and it was humbling.

On the eve of their departure, Maera brought Gond a final piece of intelligence, her face grim. “A whisper from Saltmere, carried on the black market currents. Two names you know have been seen within the city’s walls, commanding a mercenary company hired to bolster the defenses.” She paused. “Borin and Kael.”

The names stabbed into Gond’s heart like a spear, a cold shard of his past piercing the warmth of his present purpose. The faces of his former friends, twisted by betrayal, rose in his mind. The old Gond, the mercenary, would have felt a surge of vengeful satisfaction. The paladin felt a profound sorrow, and a weary resignation.

He closed his eyes for a moment, the divine presence a steady warmth within him. Alanyi’s voice from the council chamber echoed in his memory: *In every act of mercy… I am there.*

“This changes nothing of our objective,” Gond said, his voice quiet but firm. “Saltmere will be liberated. Alanyi’s temple will be reclaimed.”

Maera watched him, her sharp eyes missing little. “And if you face them?”

“Then I will offer them the same choice we offer every soul in that city: turn to the light, or be swept away with the darkness.” He met her gaze. “Alanyi’s mercy extends even to those who have lost their way. But her justice is also inevitable for those who cling to corruption.”

Later that night, as the army lay encamped on a ridge overlooking the distant, starlit gleam of the sea, with Saltmere a smudge of deeper darkness on the horizon, Gond walked among his soldiers. He saw humans, dwarves, and a few elves sharing rations, their conversations a low murmur of anticipation and prayer. He saw Sim anointing a young soldier’s shield with holy water, the boy’s face earnest and hopeful.

He found Elena staring out towards the enemy city. “They say Saltmere’s walls are built with the bones of slaves,” she said, her voice tight. “That the mortar was mixed with their tears.”

“Then we shall wash those walls with hope,” Gond replied, standing beside her. “And rebuild its heart with compassion.”

“You truly believe we can do this?” she asked, turning to him. “Not just win, but… heal?”

Gond looked at the sprawling camp, at the diverse souls united under a banner of almost impossible idealism. He thought of Alanyi’s voice, of Sim’s quiet faith, of Silviana’s ancient wisdom, of Thorek’s steadfast strength, of the courage of men like Sir Marcus who had dared to change.

“I believe Alanyi did not speak through me only to see us fail,” he said. “The path is hard, the cost will be great. But yes, Elena. I believe. We are the tide, and the darkness cannot hold us back.”

He was to address the assembled captains one last time before the march began at first light, but for now, he sought a moment of quiet. He found a secluded outcrop of rock, the wind cool on his face. He didn’t pray in words, not anymore. He simply opened himself to the divine presence, feeling its steady, loving power flow through him, a silent communion that strengthened his resolve.

   
 

# **Chapter 24: The Shadow of Gorlatch**

The army, a river of steel and prayer, flowed south. Each dawn painted the sky with hues of Alanyi’s hope, yet each morning also brought a subtle chill. Two days into their march from the encampment to Saltmere’s distant promise, a disquieting pattern emerged. First, a dwarven scout, then a human forager, then another scout—this one elven—failed to answer morning muster.  
Sir Marcus Brightwater, his newfound zeal for Alanyi’s cause still warring with ingrained Noble Knight disdain, was overheard muttering to his men about “lack of discipline” and “cowards finding their true colors.” Gond, riding near the column’s head with Elena and Silviana, heard him. His jaw tightened, a muscle twitching, but he kept his peace, just flicked a look at Maera. The spymaster’s network was already sifting through the ranks for whispers, for any hint of unease that might explain the disappearances.

“The dwarven front reports continued success at Blackrock Pass,” a messenger announced, interrupting the somber mood of the morning briefing. “Thorek’s forces have pushed deeper, and the Pilgrim’s Rest shrine is now a beacon for refugees. He sends word that their masons are eager to assist Sim’s acolytes.” Another rider, cloaked in forest green, followed. “Captain Lyralei confirms the Thornwood routes remain choked for Gorlatch’s lackeys. Several more corrupted way-shrines now sing with ancient elven clarity.”

Gond nodded, the good news a small comfort against the worry chewing at him. “Alanyi blesses them. Let’s make sure we’re pulling our weight just as hard.”

The road wound through increasingly desolate country, the land itself seeming to hold its breath. It was here, in a narrow defile choked with thorny scrub, that first blood was shed. A volley of black-fletched arrows hissed from the ridge lines. Slaver loyalists, desperate and cornered, judging by their ragged appearance.

The column reacted with a discipline born of shared purpose. Dwarven shield-bearers formed a bulwark, their heavy armor deflecting the worst of the volley. Elven archers returned fire with deadly precision, their arrows finding marks with almost supernatural accuracy. Amidst the chaos, Sir Kaelen, one of Brightwater’s knights, found himself unhorsed, his leg pinned. A hulking slaver, brandishing a cruel-looking falchion, bore down on him. Before Kaelen could bring his own sword to bear, a figure in patched leather, a former quarry slave named Joric, slammed his rough-hewn shield into the slaver’s side, then drove a short spear through the man’s throat. Joric offered a calloused hand to the astonished knight. Kaelen, after a moment’s hesitation, grasped it, hauled to his feet by the man he might once have considered less than human. The knight’s muttered thanks was gruff, but his eyes held a new light.

The skirmish was brief, brutal, and ultimately, a small victory. But as Sim and his acolytes tended the few wounded, Gond noted the subtle shifts. Sir Kaelen sought out Joric, sharing a waterskin. A dwarven warrior clapped an elven archer on the shoulder, a gesture of rough camaraderie.

The true darkness, however, awaited them further down the road. As dusk fell, they made camp in a grove of petrified trees, their skeletal forms clawing at the fading light. The very air seemed to thicken, pressing against their lungs with each breath. Birds fell silent mid-song, their forms dropping from branches like stones. Even the wind died, leaving an oppressive vacuum that made ears ring and hearts pound with unnatural rhythm.

It struck without warning. Not with the clash of steel, but with a creeping, insidious chill that seeped into the very marrow. Illusions flickered at the edge of vision: loved ones in peril, past failures replayed with agonizing clarity, grotesque figures whispering insidious doubts. Fear, cold and cloying, wrapped around hearts and minds. Several soldiers screamed, dropping their weapons to clutch their heads, their fingernails drawing blood as they clawed at their scalps. Others fell to their knees, retching violently as terror twisted their guts into knots. A young archer began weeping uncontrollably, his bow forgotten as phantom images beckoned him toward the shadows.

“Gorlatch\!” Silviana hissed, her face chalky but her eyes blazing as she started a counter-chant, her voice a thin silver thread against the crushing dark.

Three shapes detached themselves from the deepest gloom of the dead trees, cloaked and blurry, but stinking of pure evil. “The Master of Chains remembers those who stand in his way, paladin,” one grated, like rocks grinding. “You killed his servants, interrupted his plans. Now pay the price.”

Gond felt Alanyi’s fire roar up inside him, a shield of pure heat against the mind-twisting attack. “Feel Alanyi’s wrath, servants of a bad master\!” he bellowed, yanking his sword free. The blade, Alanyi’s gift, blazed with a pure, golden light, cutting through the oppressive gloom.

But even as Gond cleared the area around him of darkness, the gloom seemed to thicken, its tendrils wrapping around his companions. He saw Elena stumble, her hand frozen on her sword hilt, her eyes wide with an unseen terror. Thorek stood rooted, his mighty warhammer hanging limp. Sim was on his knees, chanting desperately, but his voice wavered.

Without thought, Gond called up his light. He pushed the divine light outwards from his sword, a golden wave of courage and clarity that broke the hold of the fear-spell on his companions. Elena gasped, her sword clearing its sheath. Thorek let out a bellow and hefted his hammer.

The Gorlatch clerics redoubled their assault. Tendrils of shadow lashed out, and a sickly green mist, carrying the stench of decay and despair, began to drift through the camp. Gond met the shadow-tendrils with sweeps of his radiant blade, each impact sending shudders through the unholy energy. He felt only a slight tingling, but noted his companions wincing in pain and fear.

He ignored it, focusing the divine power. He held his sword aloft, and a beam shot up from it, exploding in brilliance and lighting the sky. The scene was bathed in a golden glow, the shadow-tendrils melting under its brilliance. The three priests growled and faltered. Gond took his opportunity and drove the blade deep into the heart of the first, who crumpled to the ground. The remaining two faltered, their illusions flickering. Elena and Thorek, bolstered by Gond’s light, charged. Silviana’s counter-chant grew stronger, weaving a web of protective energy.

The battle was short but desperate. Gond battered the second cleric repeatedly with his sword until this one also slumped limply. The third, seeing its companions destroyed, attempted to flee but was caught by a perfectly aimed arrow from an elven archer who had shaken off the fear.

As the last vestiges of Gorlatch’s magic dissipated, a collective groan went up from the afflicted soldiers. Many were writhing, their skin clammy, the black poison coursing through them. Gond, swaying on his feet from the expenditure of power, moved among them. He laid his hands on the nearest, a young woman from the valley, her face contorted in agony. Alanyi’s light flowed, and the black ichor receded from her veins. He moved to the next, and the next, the divine energy pouring from him, also lending him strength so he could continue. By the time the last victim was cleansed, Gond collapsed, the light in his blade dimming. Sim and Silviana were at his side instantly, and guided him to a pallet.

Three days later, battered but unbroken, the army crested the final ridge. Below them lay Saltmere, its formidable walls a scar upon the coastline, the harbor choked with slaver galleys. The air, even at this distance, seemed tainted with the city’s misery.

As the army started digging in, Maera’s top scout, Lyra—all whipcord and fury—found Gond. “High Paladin,” she bit out, her face a thundercloud. “We found ’em. The missing ones.”

She led Gond, Sim, and a grim-faced Sir Marcus to a ravine half a league from Saltmere’s western wall. The stench hit them first—a coppery, foul miasma that spoke of unimaginable suffering. Flies rose in black clouds from the depths, their buzzing a hellish chorus that seemed to mock the silence of the dead. Maggots writhed in pale masses across surfaces that had once been human flesh. The very stones of the ravine were stained dark with dried blood, and strange symbols carved into the rock still seemed to pulse with malevolent energy. In the ravine’s depths lay a pit. And in the pit, the bodies of the lost scouts and foragers. They had been tortured, their flesh bearing the unmistakable marks of Gorlatch’s ritual cruelty—precise cuts that formed blasphemous patterns, burns that spoke of heated iron applied with deliberate artistry, and worse violations that made even hardened warriors turn away in revulsion.

Two figures still clung to life, their breaths shallow, their eyes vacant with horrors seen. One was the dwarven scout, Borin Stonebeard, a distant cousin to Thorek. The other, the young human forager, Elara.

Gond knelt, his heart a cold stone in his chest. He reached for Borin, Alanyi’s light flaring in his hands. The dwarf’s wounds began to close, color returning to his ash-grey skin. His breathing deepened.

Then Gond turned to Elara. As he prepared to channel the healing light again, his breathing slowed to match some deeper rhythm, his shoulders settling as if an invisible weight had descended upon them. His hands, which had been trembling with urgency, grew perfectly steady. The divine presence within him shifted, not withdrawing but changing, becoming something vast and sorrowful and infinitely wise. *Ease her suffering, my son. But her path ends here.*

Gond froze. The command was clear, unmistakable. He looked at Elara’s ravaged form, at the flicker of awareness returning to Borin’s eyes. The memory of a past defiance, a past insistence on his own judgment in matters of life and death, pricked at him. This time, the weight of Alanyi’s wisdom, her sorrow, was too profound to question. With tears stinging his eyes, he laid his hands on Elara. A soft, warm light enveloped her, not mending, but soothing. The pain lines on her face eased. A faint, almost peaceful sigh escaped her lips. And then, she was still.

Sim, who had witnessed the subtle shift in Gond’s demeanor, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. Sir Marcus, his face pale, simply stared, the last vestiges of his noble arrogance stripped away by the raw horror and the quiet, terrible mercy he had just witnessed.

The discovery of the pit, and Elara’s passing, sent a wave of transformation through the army. Hands clenched into fists until knuckles cracked white. Jaws locked tight enough to make teeth ache. Eyes hardened to chips of flint, and voices dropped to deadly whispers when they spoke at all. The siege of Saltmere began in earnest. Grimjaw’s engines, now bearing names like “Alanyi’s Judgment” and “Hope’s Hammer,” were maneuvered into position, their crews working with grim determination. Elven archers took to the high ground, their arrows a constant harassment to the city’s defenders. Dwarven engineers began constructing siege towers, their hammers ringing like funeral bells for Saltmere’s reign of terror. The harbor was blockaded, Grimjaw’s largest catapults re-angled to deny entry or escape to any vessel.

Meanwhile, with Silviana’s help, a chosen band of warriors planned their assault through the tunnels. Grimjaw’s diversion at the gates would turn into a frontal assault once the tunnel force fought to the walls and opened the gates.

On the third day of the siege, a white banner appeared above Saltmere’s main gate. A delegation of five individuals, robed and unarmed, emerged.

Gond met them in the no-man’s-land between the siege lines and the city walls, flanked by Sim, Silviana, Elena, and Thorek. The lead delegate, a portly man with shifty eyes, introduced himself as Guildmaster Theron.

“High Paladin,” Theron began, his voice unctuous. “The council of Saltmere recognizes the… disruption your forces have caused. We are prepared to offer a compromise. A significant tribute, an agreement to limit certain… less savory aspects of our trade, in return for your army’s withdrawal.”

Gond’s eyes were like frozen ponds. “We don’t make deals with evil, Guildmaster. My terms are plain. Every slave in this city walks free. Every Gorlatch priest and bootlicker answers for what they’ve done. And you throw open your gates to Alanyi, so her light can wash this filth clean.”

Theron went white. “That’s… that’s not possible.”

“Non-negotiable,” Gond said, his voice flat. “Tell your council. You’ve got until sunup tomorrow. After that, Alanyi’s judgment will fall on you.”

The delegation, visibly shaken, promised to deliver the terms. They turned and began the slow walk back towards Saltmere’s gates. As they neared the walls, a volley of crossbow bolts suddenly erupted from the battlements. The first bolt took Theron in the chest, punching through his robes with a wet thunk and emerging from his back in a spray of crimson. He pitched forward, his hands clawing at the dirt as blood frothed from his lips. The second delegate spun like a dancer as a bolt caught him in the shoulder, tearing through muscle and bone with a sound like splitting wood. He screamed, a high, keening wail that echoed off the walls. The third crumpled as twin bolts found his legs, shattering bone and sending him writhing in the dust. The delegates cried out, falling one by one, pierced by shafts fired by their own guards. One, a younger man, despite a bolt in his shoulder, managed to stagger, stumble, and half-crawl back towards Gond’s lines before collapsing, leaving a trail of blood in the sand.

Pell was the first to reach him. The young delegate, choking on his own blood, gasped, “Gorlatch… controls everything… They… they laughed at your terms… said the Master of Chains would feast…” His eyes glazed over.

The betrayal was absolute, the message chillingly clear. There would be no surrender.

Gond looked towards the bloodstained walls of Saltmere, his expression hard as granite. The setting sun cast long, menacing shadows from the siege engines, now silent sentinels of the retribution to come. The harbor lay still, a dark mirror under the twilight sky, effectively sealed. The army waited, a coiled spring of righteous fury.

The siege of Saltmere had truly begun.

   
 

# **Chapter 25: The Cleansing Tide**

The dawn over Saltmere broke red and angry, its crimson light reflecting off the steel of weapons and the grim faces of soldiers who had watched their delegation murdered in cold blood. Hands gripped sword hilts with white knuckles. Jaws clenched tight enough to make teeth ache. The betrayal had stripped away any lingering hope for a peaceful resolution; only the hard language of steel and divine fire remained. Gond stood upon a makeshift platform of siege engine timbers, his gaze fixed on the city that had become a festering wound on Alanyi’s coast.  
“They picked their side,” Gond’s voice, boosted by a touch of Alanyi’s power, cut through the morning air. “They chose the shadows. Today, they learn what that choice costs. Today, Alanyi’s light comes back to Saltmere\!”

A roar answered him, a wave of sound from human, dwarf, and elf alike. Grimjaw’s engines, “Hope’s Hammer” and “Alanyi’s Judgment,” thundered their assent, hurling massive stones against the already battered ramparts. This was the signal.

 

**The Hammer of Justice**

Silviana’s ancient knowledge had revealed the hidden ways, tunnels carved when the world was younger, leading beneath Saltmere’s western flank, towards the rumored Sunken Grotto. While Grimjaw’s bombardment drew the defenders’ eyes to the main gates, Gond led a strike force of five hundred—his own veterans, Sir Marcus’s repentant knights, and a formidable company of Thorek’s Iron Covenant dwarves—into the damp darkness.  
The tunnels opened into a series of vast cisterns beneath the city. The air was thick with the stench of stagnant water and something fouler, something that spoke of Gorlatch’s taint. They emerged into the slave quarter, the element of surprise absolute. The fighting erupted in narrow confines—steel rang against steel in doorways barely wide enough for two men, boots slipped on blood-slicked cobblestones, and the screams of the wounded echoed off crumbling tenement walls. Warriors pressed shoulder to shoulder, unable to swing their weapons in full arcs, reduced to stabbing thrusts and desperate grappling. Gond’s sword, blazing with Alanyi’s light, was a beacon in the chaos, his presence bolstering his warriors, his strikes felling slaver guards and Gorlatch cultists with terrible efficiency.

The battle for Saltmere became a grinding advance. A contingent branched off to take the walls, and Elena Brightblade’s main force, seeing the pre-arranged smoke signal from the gates, launched their assault. The true turning point came at the Grand Market, a sprawling plaza that had become a fortified slaver stronghold. Gond’s forces were pinned down by heavy crossbow fire from barricaded merchant houses.

It was then the dwarves made their mark. Thorek’s cousin, Borin Stonebeard, his knuckles white around his warhammer’s grip and his beard bristling with barely contained rage from his recent ordeal, led his Iron Covenant warriors in a seemingly suicidal charge. Not directly at the barricades, but at the foundations of the largest slaver-held building. With mighty swings of their warhammers, the dwarves smashed through stone and timber. The structure groaned, then collapsed inwards with a deafening roar, taking dozens of defenders with it and sowing chaos among the rest.

“Alanyi’s mercy for the oppressed\!” Gond roared, seizing the moment. “Turin’s justice for the oppressor\!” He led the charge through the dust and confusion. The slavers’ line broke.

By midday, the fight had reached the desecrated Sunken Grotto. What had once been a place of healing waters was now a pit of filth and despair, Gorlatch’s symbols defiling every surface. Here, the resistance was fanatical, led by priests of the chained god. But Gond, his power fueled by righteous anger and Alanyi’s sorrow, was an unstoppable force. The Grotto was reclaimed, its dark energies scoured by divine light.

As the sun began to dip towards the sea, Saltmere fell. The last pockets of resistance were crushed. Sim, tears streaming down his face, began the first rites of purification in the Grotto, Silviana at his side, her elven chants weaving with his human prayers. The liberation of slaves, a tide of humanity blinking in newfound freedom, began under Elena’s organized command. Saltmere, the first jewel of the Slavers’ Coast, was cleansed.

In the hours following Saltmere’s fall, as Sim and his acolytes worked to purify the Sunken Grotto, Gond walked among the wounded. Not just his own soldiers, but the enemy casualties as well. It was something that had become his practice—to offer healing even to those who had fought against him, if they would accept it.

Most of the slaver defenders were beyond help, their wounds too severe or their spirits already departed. But in a narrow alley near the Grand Market, he found a figure slumped against a bloodstained wall, breathing shallow and labored.

The man’s face was turned away, but something about his build, the way he held himself even in defeat, struck Gond as familiar. When the wounded fighter looked up, recognition hit like a physical blow.

“Kael.”

His former friend’s eyes widened, then closed as if in pain that had nothing to do with his wounds. “Gond. I… I didn’t think you’d come this way.”

Gond knelt beside him, taking in the severity of the injuries. A deep sword thrust to the side, blood loss, infection already setting in. Without intervention, Kael would be dead within the hour.

“You came back,” Gond said, his voice quiet, more sad than angry. “After we gave you Alanyi’s mercy. You came back to fight for *them*.”

Kael coughed, a wet, bloody sound. “What else was I gonna do, Gond? You set us free, sure, but you didn’t exactly roll out the welcome mat. Mercenary work? It’s all I know.”

“So you picked the slavers.” Not a question, a flat statement.

“I picked eating,” Kael rasped. “Coin in my purse, a roof over my head. Told myself it was just a job. But when the fighting started…” He gestured feebly at his side. “Killing unarmed slaves isn’t battle, it’s murder. I hesitated. And hesitation’ll kill you in this business.”

Gond felt the familiar warmth building in his chest, Alanyi’s power responding to the pain—not just physical, but spiritual—that radiated from his former friend. He could heal these wounds. The question was whether he should.

“Do you want to live, Kael?” Gond asked, his voice surprisingly gentle.

Kael’s eyes searched his. “Why ask? You’ll do what you think is right. Always did.”

“Maybe. But I’m asking.”

A long pause. “Yeah,” Kael breathed. “Yeah, I want to live. Not ’cause I deserve it. Just… I’m tired, Gond. Tired of this life, selling my sword to whoever’s buying, no questions asked.”

Gond placed his hands on Kael’s wounded side. The divine power flowed through him, seeking out the damaged tissue. But Kael’s connection to Alanyi was weak, making the conduit difficult to form. Gond drew from Kael’s own reserves-his will to live-to maintain the conduit to Alanyi’s divine power, fighting back the infection, knitting torn flesh together. Kael gasped as the pain flared, then receded, his breathing steadying.

“Why?” Kael whispered, the healing light fading. “After all of it… the betrayal, me fighting for them again… why?”

“Mercy’s not about earning it, Kael,” Gond said, helping him sit up. “It’s a gift. Now it’s up to you to figure out how to be worthy of it.”

Kael stared at his healed side, then up at Gond, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. “So… now what?”

“Now you choose,” Gond said, getting to his feet. “Go back to selling your sword… or find a different way.”

“What different way? This is all I got.”

“Then learn something new.” Gond gestured to the city, where the newly freed were starting to move, to hope. “Folks here need help. Real help. Temples to rebuild, lives to put back together. There’s work, Kael, for men willing to serve something bigger than their own pockets.”

Kael pushed himself up, testing his side. “You think a dog like me could do that?”

“I think any man can change, if he wants it enough.” Gond met his gaze. “Question is, Kael, do you want it enough to do the work? To actually *be* different?”

He left Kael standing in the alley, alive and whole, staring at his hands as if seeing them for the first time. What the man would do with this second chance remained to be seen. But for the first time since their paths had crossed again, Gond felt something like hope for his former friend.


**The Spark of Rebellion**

The victory at Saltmere sent ripples along the coast. After a week of rest, resupply, and the establishment of a provisional council under Sim’s spiritual guidance, Gond’s army marched on Blackwater. The city was smaller than Saltmere, but its reputation for cruelty was just as dark.  
The siege of Blackwater began much like Saltmere’s, with Grimjaw’s engines pounding the walls. But Maera’s network had been busy. Whispers of Saltmere’s fall, of slaves freed and a benevolent goddess returning, had found fertile ground within Blackwater’s oppressed populace. On the third night of the siege, as Gond’s forces prepared for another tunnel assault, the city itself erupted.

Fires bloomed in the merchant district like deadly flowers. Shouts and the clash of makeshift weapons echoed from within—kitchen knives against guard swords, cobblestones hurled from rooftops, chains broken and turned into flails. A significant portion of the city guard, long resentful of the Gorlatch cultists’ iron grip and perhaps swayed by Maera’s agents, turned on their masters. The rebellion was chaotic, desperate, but it threw Blackwater’s defenses into disarray.

“Now\!” Gond yelled, his voice cutting through the chaos. “Alanyi’s with the bold\! Go\!”

The assault was swift. With defenders fighting on two fronts, the walls were breached with surprising ease. Gond’s army poured into a city already tearing itself apart. They linked up with rebel factions, guiding the chaotic energy towards the inner keep, the black heart of Blackwater where the slaver lords and Gorlatch’s priests made their stand.

The keep was a fortress of despair. Its dungeons, when finally breached, revealed horrors that chilled even the most hardened veterans. A hidden temple to Gorlatch lay in the dungeons beneath, its altar stained with ancient blood, its cells filled with the remains of countless victims of torture and sacrifice. The air itself felt poisoned by suffering.

Sir Marcus Brightwater, witnessing the depths of the depravity his former order had tacitly supported, sank to his knees, his face ashen. “May Turin forgive us,” he choked out. “May Alanyi cleanse us.”

Gond, his expression grim, placed a hand on the knight’s shoulder. “They will, if our actions now prove worthy.” The capture of Blackwater was a victory, but the discovery within its keep was a stark reminder of the true enemy’s nature.


**The Light of Divine Confrontation**

Port Sorrow was the last of the three great slaver cities on Slaver’s Coast. As Gond’s army approached, an eerie stillness hung over it. Scouts reported that most of the regular soldiers had fled, deserting their posts. Yet, the city was not undefended. Three ominous black-sailed ships lay anchored in its harbor, and the ramparts were manned by figures in dark robes—Gorlatch’s elite clerics.  
As the army arrayed itself for the assault, a wave of pure terror washed over them. It was not the fear of battle, but a supernatural dread, far more potent than any they had faced before. Soldiers screamed, dropping weapons, their courage dissolving like mist. Horses reared, throwing their riders. Even seasoned warriors like Elena and Pell faltered, their faces pale with an unseen horror.

Gond felt the icy tendrils of fear attempt to grip his own heart, but Alanyi’s fire burned within him, a defiant inferno. He saw his army, his people, on the verge of collapse. He knew what he had to do.

He strode to the front lines, his sword held high. “Alanyi\!” he roared, his voice a challenge to the encroaching darkness. Raising his sword, he sent its light into the sky.

The effect was instantaneous and overwhelming. A column of incandescent white light erupted from his sword, soaring into the sky before exploding outwards, bathing Port Sorrow and the surrounding lands in a blinding, purifying radiance. The oppressive fear shattered like glass struck by a hammer. The shadows receded like living things fleeing from flame. Courage, warm and fierce, flooded back into the hearts of his soldiers—shoulders straightened, weapons were retrieved with steady hands, and battle cries replaced screams of terror. The three black ships in the harbor smoldered, then caught fire, their unholy timbers consumed by the divine light.

The effort was immense. Gond felt his life force drain as if an ocean were emptying through him. His knees buckled, his vision blurred to gray at the edges, and then he collapsed, the world dissolving into blackness.

When he awoke, it was to Sim’s anxious face and Silviana’s cool hand on his brow. The sounds of battle still raged, but they were distant.

“The city…?” Gond managed, his throat raw.

“Your light broke their power, Gond,” Silviana said, her voice a quiet balm. “The army’s fighting with new heart. But their strongest priests… they’ve taken refuge in Gorlatch’s main temple. Shielded by shadow. No one can get near.”

Gond pushed himself up, every muscle screaming, but his eyes were clear. “Then I go.”

Supported by Sim and Elena, he made his way to the heart of Port Sorrow. The temple of Gorlatch was a blasphemous edifice of black stone, pulsating with a visible aura of dark energy. Before it, his army waited, unable to breach the shimmering wall of shadow.

Gond stepped forward alone. “Servants of the Chained God\!” His voice was thin, but it cracked with an authority that wasn’t entirely his own. “Your master’s time is up\!”

The barrier shimmered, and a figure oozed out—the High Priest of Gorlatch, eyes like burning coals, power crackling around him like dark lightning. “Foolish whelp. You play with powers you can’t even imagine.”

“And I wield a power you’ve long forgotten,” Gond shot back, finding a spark of strength. “Hope. Mercy. Today you’ll learn that these are stronger than hate.”

The battle that followed was not of steel, but of spirit. The High Priest, a conduit for Gorlatch’s malevolent will, unleashed blasts of shadow, whispers of despair, illusions of torment. Gond, drawing upon his last reserves, channeled Alanyi’s grace. He met the High Priests' unholy magic with shields of light, affirmations of faith, and the unwavering conviction of a soul dedicated to healing.

Darkness surged, threatening to overwhelm, but Alanyi’s light, though sometimes flickering, refused to be extinguished. Gond felt her presence, her sorrow for a world so wounded, her fierce love for her children. He became more than Gond; he became her sword, her shield, her unwavering heart. Despite his exhaustion, Gond felt a renewed strength as Alanyi’s power restored him.

With a final, desperate surge, the High Priest channeled Gorlatch’s essence. A colossal shadow of the Chained God loomed over the temple, its ethereal chains rattling. But Gond met it with an equally potent manifestation of Alanyi—a radiant figure of light and compassion, whose gentle strength seemed to dissolve the very chains of the shadow.

The High Priest screamed as the divine energies collided, his form consumed first by shadow, then by a cleansing fire. The dark temple shuddered, its black stones cracking, and then, with a sound like a dying god’s sigh, it imploded, collapsing into a ruin from which pure, white light emanated.

Gond stood, swaying but triumphant, Alanyi’s light fading gently around him. Port Sorrow was free.


**March to Aid the Dwarves**

The coastal campaign was over. Saltmere, Blackwater, Port Sorrow were all cleansed, their slave pens emptied, their dark temples shattered. Gond, recovering slowly from the divine duel, oversaw the initial stages of restoration, Sim and Silviana working tirelessly to establish Alanyi’s worship and heal the deep scars left by Gorlatch’s reign.  
Weeks passed. The army, though weary, was buoyed by its victories. Then, a dust-caked dwarven messenger arrived, bearing an urgent dispatch from Thorek Ironheart.

“High Paladin,” the dwarf announced, his voice hoarse with fatigue and the strain of hard riding. “Thorek sends greetings and a plea. We have besieged the Citadel of Asham-Val, the last great stronghold of the corrupt Order of Turin in the Gray Peaks. Their defenses are formidable, their resolve hardened by desperation. We have them contained, but breaking their walls proves… costly. The King requests your aid, that our victory might be swift and the suffering lessened.”

Gond listened, his gaze distant. The Citadel of Asham-Val. He knew its reputation—a fortress deemed impregnable, the heart of the human faction that still clung to the old ways of oppression, that had profited from the slave trade and resisted Alanyi’s return.

His own army was tired. He was tired. But the war was not yet won. The dwarves, their staunchest allies, had called for aid.

He looked at Elena, at Sir Marcus, at Pell and Maera. Their expressions mirrored his own understanding.

“Get the captains,” Gond said, his voice finding its old steel. “Tell the army. We move at dawn.” He looked at the dwarven messenger, a weary but determined smile touching his lips. “Tell Thorek the Cleansing Tide’s rolling inland. We’re on our way.”

   
 

# **Chapter 26: The Wrath of Gods**

The Citadel of Asham-Val squatted on its rocky outcrop like a diseased tooth, its black stone walls scarred by weeks of dwarven siege engines. Gond reined in his horse at the crest of the hill, studying the fortress that had once been a beacon of Turin’s justice and now served as the final stronghold of corruption.  
“Solid walls,” Pell remarked, pulling up alongside. “Too bad about the folks inside.”

Below them, the combined army stretched across the valley floor—humans, dwarves, and elves united in common cause. Smoke rose from a dozen siege positions where Grimjaw’s engines hurled stone and fire at the citadel’s walls. The sound of metal on stone rang across the landscape like a blacksmith’s hammer, punctuated by the occasional crash of falling masonry.

“Any word from Thorek?” Elena asked, her armor gleaming in the afternoon sun.

“He’s waiting for us at the command post,” Sim replied, pointing toward a cluster of banners near the siege lines. “Says he has something important to discuss.”

Gond nudged his horse forward, and the others followed. As they descended toward the siege camp, soldiers looked up from their work—human faces mixing with dwarven beards and elven features in a sight that would have been impossible just months ago. Some raised weapons in salute, others simply nodded, but all watched him pass with the quiet respect of warriors who had seen their leader tested in battle.

The command post buzzed with activity. Maps covered every available surface, marked with siege positions, supply lines, and assault routes. Thorek Ironheart stood at the center of it all, his massive frame bent over a detailed sketch of the citadel’s defenses. The dwarven war-priest looked up as Gond approached, his weathered face creasing into a grim smile.

“About time you showed up,” Thorek grumbled, but his grip on Gond’s forearm was firm. “We were starting to think you’d let us have all the fun.”

“Looks like you’ve been busy,” Gond said, eyes scanning the map. Breaches marked the outer wall, siege towers loomed.

“Aye, chewed through the rind, no problem,” Thorek said, jabbing a thumb at the citadel’s core—a monster of a tower. “But the heart of it? That’s where the rot’s dug in. Priests, their pet guards. Maybe two hundred, all frothing at the mouth. And that keep…” He spat. “Built like a mountain. Walls thicker’n a giant’s skull, wards that’ll laugh at steel and spit back spells.”

Gond frowned. “What about divine power?”

“Tried it myself,” Thorek admitted, his voice carrying frustration. “The corruption runs deep, but the foundations are still blessed by Turin’s own hand. When I struck them with my hammer, calling on Turin’s might, the stones shimmered with Turin’s silver light, and I felt a jolt as if lightning itself pushed back. It resists even righteous force.”

“Then how do we reach them?”

Thorek’s eyes gleamed with something between hope and uncertainty. “There might be a way. But it’s dangerous, and it requires…” He glanced around the tent, then lowered his voice. “It requires awakening something that’s been sleeping for three centuries.”

He led them to a smaller section of the map, pointing to a structure near the base of the keep. “The Hall of Guardians. Built by my ancestors when the alliance between our peoples was strong, when Turin and Alanyi worked hand in hand to protect the innocent.”

Silviana stepped closer, her ancient eyes studying the markings. “I remember the stories. Four Guardians, wrought of stone and steel, animated by Turin’s own wrath against injustice.” Her voice was hushed, and as she spoke of that wrath, a faint scent of ozone seemed to touch the air in the command tent, as if the memory alone carried a spark of its power.

“Aye,” Thorek nodded. “The Guardians of Turin. My people built them as the ultimate expression of divine justice—constructs that could channel the god’s power directly, arcs of silver lightning occasionally visible within their stone frames even in dormancy, unstoppable in their purpose.” His expression darkened. “But when the schism came, when humans and dwarves went their separate ways, the knowledge of their awakening was… divided.”

“Divided how?” Gond asked.

“The rituals, the words of power—my battlemasters still know them. Passed down through generations, kept alive in our war-chants and ceremonies. But the divine spark needed to wake them…” Thorek looked directly at Gond. “That requires a level of power we haven’t possessed since the old alliances broke.”

A shiver traced Gond’s spine. “You want me to wake them.”

“Humans don’t even remember what they are,” Thorek pressed on. “Think the Hall’s just a dusty storeroom. The guard is light, sloppy. But that keep, where the filth is hiding…” He jabbed the map again. “That’s a nut we can’t crack, not with what we’ve got.”

“Unless the Guardians can,” Silviana murmured, her eyes distant.

“But I’m Alanyi’s paladin,” Gond argued, a knot tightening in his gut. “My strength is hers, not Turin’s. How in the blazes am I supposed to—”

“Because they were allies once,” Silviana interrupted, her voice carrying the weight of ancient memory. “In the early days, before the world grew dark and divided, Turin and Alanyi worked together. Justice and mercy, strength and compassion—two faces of the same divine truth. The rituals were designed for both powers working in harmony.”

Thorek nodded eagerly. “My grandfather’s grandfather told stories of the old ceremonies. Priests of both gods standing together, their powers intertwined like the roots of a great tree. If anyone could bridge that gap…” He looked at Gond with something approaching reverence. “It would be you.”

Gond stared at the map, his mind racing. The idea was audacious, dangerous, and possibly suicidal. But if it worked…

“What would I need to do?”

“A small team,” Thorek said immediately. “Three people at most, to avoid drawing attention. You, one of my battlemasters who knows the awakening rites, and…” He glanced at Silviana. “Someone who understands the old bonds between the gods.”

“I’ll go,” Silviana said without hesitation. “This is what I came here for—to see the ancient alliances restored.”

“The guards?” Pell asked, ever practical.

“Six men, maybe eight,” Thorek replied. “Professional soldiers, but not expecting trouble. The real challenge will be the ritual itself. If it fails…”

“If it fails, we’re back where we started,” Gond said, trying to sound more sure than he felt. “And if it works?”

Thorek’s grin was all teeth and fire, a flicker of silver in his eyes. “If it works, those oathbreakers will find out what Turin’s real anger feels like—a silver storm, quick and final.”

The approach to the Hall of Guardians took them through a maze of rubble and abandoned outbuildings. The siege had reduced much of the citadel’s outer structures to ruins, providing ample cover for their small party. Gond moved carefully through the debris, his divine senses alert for any sign of danger.

Beside him, Korgan Ironbeard—Thorek’s chosen battlemaster—muttered prayers under his breath. The dwarven warrior carried an ancient hammer inscribed with runes that seemed to pulse with a faint, inner silver light, an occasional tiny spark escaping the etched symbols. His beard was braided with iron rings that chimed softly with each step, and his eyes held the fervor of one who had waited his entire life for this moment.

Silviana brought up the rear, her elven grace allowing her to move through the rubble without disturbing so much as a pebble. She carried her staff of white wood that seemed to glow faintly in the gathering dusk, and her lips moved in silent prayers to Alanyi.

“There,” Korgan whispered, pointing ahead.

The Hall of Guardians stood before them, a low building of black stone that seemed to absorb the fading light. Unlike the ornate architecture of the keep, this structure was purely functional—thick walls, narrow windows, and a single heavy door bound with iron. Two guards stood at the entrance, their attention focused outward toward the siege lines.

“Six more inside,” Gond murmured, his senses sharp. “I can hear them playing dice.”

“Cocky fools,” Korgan rumbled. “Think these stones’ll keep ’em safe.”

“They’re in for a rude awakening,” Silviana said, a glint in her ancient eyes that spoke of elven steel.

The attack was swift and quiet. Gond’s blade silenced the first guard. Silviana’s staff flared, and the second dropped without a sound. They dragged the bodies into the shadows and faced the door.

“Ready?” Gond asked, his voice low.

Korgan’s hammer began to glow brighter, and Silviana’s staff hummed with barely contained power. Gond drew his sword, feeling Alanyi’s presence stir within him.

The door burst inward with a crash that echoed through the hall. The six guards inside scrambled for their weapons, but they were too slow. Gond moved like a whirlwind, his blade weaving patterns of silver light that cut through armor and flesh with equal ease. Korgan’s hammer sang as it crushed bone and steel, while Silviana’s magic turned aside sword strokes and sent men flying into the walls.

The fight was brief but vicious. When the last guard fell, the hall was silent except for the sound of their breathing and the distant rumble of siege engines.

“This way,” Korgan said, leading them deeper into the structure.

The inner chamber took Gond’s breath away. Four massive figures stood in alcoves carved from the living rock, each one a masterpiece of dwarven craftsmanship and divine artistry. The Guardians were humanoid in shape but larger than any mortal man, their bodies wrought from stone and steel that seemed to shimmer with inner fire. Their faces were stern and noble, carved with an attention to detail that made them seem almost alive. Each carried a different weapon—a massive axe, a war hammer, a two-handed sword, and a spear that crackled with dormant energy.

“By the gods,” Silviana breathed. “They’re magnificent.”

“Aye,” Korgan agreed, his voice thick with emotion. “The greatest work of my people, blessed by Turin himself.” He moved to the center of the chamber, where a circular platform was inscribed with runes and symbols that hurt to look at directly. “This is where the ritual must be performed.”

Gond approached the platform slowly, feeling the weight of centuries pressing down upon him. The air itself seemed thick with potential, as if the very stones were holding their breath in anticipation.

“What do I need to do?”

“Stand in the center,” Korgan instructed, taking his position at one of the cardinal points around the circle. “Silviana, there—at the point of mercy. I’ll take the point of justice.” He began to chant in the old dwarven tongue, his voice echoing off the stone walls.

Silviana added her voice to his, singing in the liquid syllables of ancient Elvish. The two melodies intertwined, creating harmonies that seemed to resonate in Gond’s bones.

“Now,” Korgan called out. “Reach for your goddess. Let her power flow through you, but don’t try to control it. Let it find its own path.”

Gond closed his eyes and opened himself to Alanyi’s presence. The familiar warmth bloomed in his chest, but this time it felt different—stronger, more intense. He could feel the goddess’s focus upon him, her approval flowing through their connection like sunlight through crystal.

*Trust, her voice whispered in his mind. Trust in the old bonds, the ancient friendships. What was divided can be made whole.*  
The power flowed out of him and into the platform, following the carved channels like water finding its course. But as it spread, something unexpected happened. The runes began to change, shifting from the harsh angular script of dwarven tradition to the flowing curves of elven writing, then to something else entirely—symbols that seemed to combine both traditions into something new and beautiful.

“It’s working,” Silviana gasped. “The old bonds are remembering themselves.”

The chamber filled with light—not the golden radiance of Alanyi alone, but something richer and more complex. Silver and gold intertwined, justice and mercy dancing together in perfect harmony. The very air began to sing with power, and Gond felt another presence stirring—vast, ancient, and filled with righteous fury.

*Sister,* Turin’s voice rumbled through the chamber, speaking directly to Alanyi through their shared connection. *It has been too long.*

*Too long indeed, Alanyi replied, her voice warm with joy. But the need is great, and our champions have proven themselves worthy.*  
The Guardians began to move.

It started slowly—a flicker of light in stone eyes, a barely perceptible shift in posture. But as the divine power flowed into them, the changes accelerated. Eyes that had been carved from granite began to glow with inner fire, first a dull red, then blazing gold that cast dancing shadows on the walls. The weapons in their hands crackled with electricity, arcs of lightning dancing along blade edges and hammer heads.

The first Guardian—the one with the massive axe—turned its head toward Gond with a motion that was both mechanical and eerily lifelike. When it spoke, its voice was like grinding stone and distant thunder.

“Paladin of Alanyi. We hear the call of justice.”

The second Guardian, bearing the war hammer, stepped forward from its alcove with footsteps that shook the entire chamber. “The corrupt have defiled our lord’s name. They have made a mockery of justice itself.”

“They have harmed the innocent,” added the third, its two-handed sword blazing with divine fire. “They have perverted mercy into weakness and strength into cruelty.”

The fourth Guardian, wielding the crackling spear, fixed its burning gaze on Gond. “We understand our purpose. The guilty must face judgment.”

Gond felt a chill run down his spine as he looked into those blazing eyes. These were not mere constructs—they were vessels of divine wrath, animated by the combined fury of two gods who had seen their teachings twisted and corrupted.

“The keep,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “The corrupt priests are in the inner keep.”

The first Guardian nodded once, a gesture that somehow conveyed both acknowledgment and grim satisfaction. “We know. We have waited long for this moment.”

Without another word, the four Guardians began to move toward the chamber’s exit. Their footsteps shook the ground, and the very stones seemed to part before them. As they passed through the doorway, Gond caught a glimpse of their true power—the walls around the entrance cracked and crumbled, unable to withstand the divine energy that radiated from their forms.

“We should follow,” Silviana said, but her voice carried uncertainty. “To witness—”

“No,” Korgan interrupted, his face pale, voice trembling. “This is not for mortal eyes. What comes next is between the gods and those who have defiled their names.”

From outside came the sound of screaming—not the cries of battle, but the shrieks of men who had suddenly realized they faced something far beyond their understanding. The ground shook as the Guardians moved through the citadel, and flashes of lightning illuminated the windows of the inner keep.

The corrupt priests’ stronghold, which had withstood weeks of siege and resisted every assault, lasted less than ten minutes against the Guardians’ advance. Walls that had been blessed by Turin’s own power—their stones perhaps still holding faint, dormant silver energies—crumbled before constructs that carried his direct authority, the ancient wards shattering with sharp cracks like thunder. Wards that had turned aside sorcery and steel alike shattered like glass before the combined might of justice and mercy working in perfect harmony.

The screaming stopped abruptly, replaced by a silence that was somehow more terrible than any sound. Then, from the direction of the keep, came a new noise—a deep, resonant hum that seemed to come from the earth itself.

“It’s finished,” Silviana whispered.

They emerged from the Hall of Guardians to find the citadel transformed. Where the inner keep had stood, only rubble remained. The massive tower that had dominated the complex was gone, reduced to a pile of broken stone and twisted metal. And standing in the ruins, their forms beginning to fade, were the four Guardians.

As Gond watched, the divine constructs turned toward him one final time. Their eyes, which had blazed with the fire of righteous judgment, were growing dim. Cracks appeared in their stone flesh, spreading like spider webs across their mighty forms.

“It is done,” the first Guardian’s voice faded. “Justice is served. The innocent, avenged.”

“The blight is cleansed,” the second rasped, its hammer crumbling. “The guilty have answered.”

“Our task is complete,” the third stated, its sword dissolving to silver dust. “We go to our rest.”

The fourth Guardian fixed its dimming, almost human eyes on Gond. “Keep the bond. Mercy and justice.”

With those words, the Guardians crumbled to dust. The divine fire that had animated them flickered once and went out, leaving only four piles of stone and metal where the mighty constructs had stood.

Gond sank to his knees, overwhelmed by what he had witnessed. The power that had flowed through him during the ritual had left him drained, but more than that, he felt the weight of what had just occurred. The corrupt priests were dead, their stronghold destroyed, but the cost…

“They were made for this,” Silviana said softly, her hand on his shoulder. “They did their duty. Now they return to the gods.”

“It’s over,” Korgan breathed, awe in his voice. “The last den of that filth… gone. Slavery dies today, right here.”

From the siege lines came the sound of cheering as word of the keep’s destruction spread through the army. Horns blew, drums thundered, and voices rose in songs of victory and thanksgiving. The combined forces of humans, dwarves, and elves had witnessed something unprecedented—the direct intervention of the gods themselves in the affairs of mortals.

“Come on,” Silviana said, helping Gond up. “The others need to see you. They need to know what happened here.”

Gond nodded, though his legs felt unsteady. As they made their way back through the ruins of the citadel, he found himself thinking about the journey that had brought them to this moment. It had begun with betrayal and slavery, continued through rebellion and war, and now… now it was ending with something he had never expected to see.

In the days that followed, the ruins of the Citadel of Asham-Val became a place of pilgrimage. Priests of both Turin and Alanyi came to see where the ancient alliance had been renewed, where justice and mercy had worked together to cleanse corruption from the world.

The dust of the Guardians was gathered with reverence and divided among the temples of both gods, a reminder that divine power was not meant to be hoarded but shared. The Hall of Guardians itself was consecrated as a shrine to the renewed friendship between Turin and Alanyi, a place where priests of both faiths could come to remember the bonds that united them.

Most importantly, the victory at Asham-Val marked the end of organized resistance to the new order. Word spread quickly across the continent that the last stronghold of the old corruption had fallen, and with it, the final hope of those who would restore the age of slavery and oppression.

   
 

# **Chapter 27: Continent Reborn**

The air in the Grand Cathedral of Aethelburg no longer hung heavy with the scent of stale incense and fear. Sunlight, once fractured by grimy, ornate glass, now streamed through clear panes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the vast space. The old stone felt different, as if it, too, had exhaled a breath held for centuries. Sim, robed in simple, undyed linen, stood not on the ostentatious, elevated pulpit of old, but on a low, wooden platform at the heart of the nave. His voice, though unamplified by priestly artifice, reached every corner, carrying a warmth that settled over the assembled crowd like a comforting blanket. Farmers in homespun, merchants in their modest best, even a few nobles stripped of their former gilded arrogance, all sat shoulder to shoulder on plain wooden benches.  
“Alanyi’s light isn’t some treasure for a few to lock away,” Sim’s voice rang true, his eyes taking in every face. “It’s a seed for every heart to grow. You find it not in fancy temples, but in simple kindness. Not in hushed-up rules, but in a hand held out to someone who needs it.”

The Church of Alanyi, reborn from the ashes of its corrupt predecessor, flourished. Its priests and priestesses, chosen for their compassion rather than their lineage or political cunning, fanned out across the continent. They built no new cathedrals of stone and gold. Instead, they established schools in dusty villages, tended to the sick in makeshift infirmaries, and mediated disputes with a wisdom that valued fairness over favor. Tithes were no longer demanded under threat of divine retribution but offered freely, a portion of a harvest shared, a day’s labor volunteered. The change was slow, a quiet turning of the soil, but its roots ran deep.

The decree, signed by the newly formed Council of Allied Kingdoms, was read in every town square, from the bustling ports of the Southern Reach to the remote mountain holds of the North. Its language was unequivocal: “Henceforth, no man, woman, or child upon this continent shall be deemed property. The chains of bondage are broken. All are free.”

The pronouncements were met with stunned silence, then disbelief, then a wave of jubilation that swept across the lands. In the city of Veridia, once a notorious hub of the slave trade, iron collars were melted down and whips were piled high in the central plaza and set ablaze. The smoke, acrid and black, billowed into the sky, a stark contrast to the clear dawn. Former overseers, stripped of their authority, either fled or sought to blend into the crowds, their faces pale.

The transition was not without its turmoil. Some landowners, their fortunes built on the backs of unpaid labor, protested, their voices shrill with outrage. But the tide had turned. Soldiers, many of them former slaves themselves or men who had fought alongside Gond’s army, enforced the new law with grim determination. More potent than any army, however, was the collective will of a people who had tasted the bitter dregs of servitude and now breathed the sweet air of liberty. Farms were reorganized, new trades learned, and communities of freed people established themselves, their songs of resilience echoing where once only the crack of the lash was heard. The scars remained, etched into memories and landscapes, but they were now monuments to a past overcome, not chains to bind the future.

Two decades passed. The world settled into a new rhythm.

Kael, his dark hair now streaked with silver at the temples, sat on a low stone wall, the afternoon sun warming his face. A group of children, their faces bright with curiosity, gathered at his feet. They were students from the village school, their lessons for the day concluded.

“Father Kael,” a little girl with eyes like hazelnuts chirped, “is it real? Did folks… *own* other folks? Like a goat, or a wagon?” Her forehead crinkled, the idea strange and awful.

Kael’s smile was soft, with a sadness they were too young to understand. He picked up a smooth, grey pebble, rolling it in his worn hand. “It’s real, little one. Once, many hearts were so hard, they looked at their own kind and saw only tools. They’d buy ‘em and sell ‘em, work ‘em under the sun and the lash, and think it was their due.”

An older boy scowled, shaking his head. “But… why? Didn’t they know it was wrong?”

“Some did,” Kael said, his voice quiet. “Some spoke up. Some fought. But it was an old sickness, tangled up in greed and being scared. Took the whole world turning upside down, a light brighter than anything, to make everyone see clear.” He met their wide eyes. “You’re lucky, living now when that’s just a bad dream. That, little ones, is the biggest miracle. Don’t ever forget how special that is. Don’t ever let the dark sneak back in.”

The children were quiet for a moment, contemplating his words. The idea of humans as property was a dark fairy tale to them, a relic of a barbaric age they could scarcely imagine. Kael watched them, a quiet satisfaction in his chest. The lessons of the past were not always easy, but they were vital.

Gond, his once-mighty frame now leaner, his face etched with the lines of countless journeys, stood before the Council of Allied Kingdoms. They had sought him out, found him tending to lepers in a forgotten valley. The offer was grand: a position of leadership, a voice in shaping the new era, perhaps even a crown, should the kingdoms decide to unite under a single ruler. The chamber was hushed, the assembled lords and ladies awaiting his answer.

He looked at their earnest faces, at the maps spread across the great oak table, at the symbols of nascent power. He saw the weight of responsibility, the endless compromises, the slow erosion of spirit that often came with such burdens.

A faint smile touched his lips. He shook his head, a simple, unambiguous gesture. “My road goes a different way,” he said, his voice quiet but steady as a rock. “There’s still suffering in the world, not in kingdoms, but in people. My hands are for healing, not for holding a king’s scepter.”

He turned and walked from the chamber, leaving behind the stunned silence and the allure of governance. No one tried to stop him.

Years later, tales would surface. A lone healer, his touch gentle, his knowledge of herbs profound, appearing in plague-stricken villages. A quiet man who mended broken bones and broken spirits in remote settlements, asking for nothing but a little food and shelter before moving on. Some said he carried a light within him, a remnant of Alanyi’s grace. Others claimed he was merely a skilled physician, his legend growing with each retelling.

One evening, an old farmer, his granddaughter gravely ill, found a stranger sitting by his well as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple. The stranger offered a poultice of common field herbs. By morning, the child’s fever had broken. When the farmer went to thank the healer, he was gone. All that remained were his footprints in the dew-kissed grass, leading away towards the wild, open land, towards a horizon that held no promises, only the unending road.
