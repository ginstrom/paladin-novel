## Chapter Title Translation

**English**: "Burden of Grace"
**Japanese**: 「恩寵の重荷」

**Reasoning**: 
- 恩寵 (onchō) = divine grace, blessing, favor from a deity
- 重荷 (omoni) = burden, heavy load, responsibility
- This captures both the theological weight and the personal struggle Gond faces
- Alternative considered: 「慈悲の重圧」but 恩寵 better conveys the divine aspect

## New Character Introductions

### Thorek Ironheart
**English**: Thorek Ironheart
**Japanese**: ソレク・アイアンハート
**Notes**: 
- Used katakana transliteration for fantasy dwarf name
- Maintained "Ironheart" in katakana to preserve the metalworking significance
- Consistent with established naming conventions for fantasy characters

### Iron Covenant
**English**: Iron Covenant
**Japanese**: 鉄の盟約
**Notes**:
- 鉄 (tetsu) = iron, maintaining the metalworking theme
- 盟約 (meiyaku) = covenant, pact, formal alliance
- More formal than 同盟 (dōmei), emphasizing the sacred/religious nature

- 宗教的熱狂 (religious fervor) - appropriate for divine weapon recognition

### Warrior's Greeting

**Japanese**: 「伝統的な戦士の挨拶でドワーフの前腕を握った」
**Notes**: Maintained the Western fantasy convention while making it clear this is a cultural practice

## Dialogue Enhancements

### Character Voice Consistency

- Maintained his characteristic directness while showing emotional vulnerability
- Balanced formal divine interactions with casual personal speech

**Thorek's Formal Speech**:

## "Show Don't Tell" Applications

**Effect**: Physical manifestation shows emotional state

### Divine Power Loss
**Instead of**: "The divine power left him"
**Used**: 「数瞬前まで神聖なエネルギーでうずいていた指先が、今は冷たく感覚を失っていた」
**Effect**: Sensory details show spiritual disconnection

### Character Relationships
**Instead of**: "They formed an alliance"
