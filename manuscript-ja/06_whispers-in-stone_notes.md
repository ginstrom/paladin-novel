# Chapter 6 Translation Notes: 聖域への道 (Path to Sanctuary)

## Corrections Applied (2025-06-02)

### Continuity Issues Fixed
1. **Merchant smoke reference removed**: Eliminated the noon smoke passage that mentioned merchant party to resolve plot inconsistency
2. **Horse/saddle description corrected**: Changed "間に合わせの鞍の上で" to "毛布を敷いた馬の背で" to reflect that it's a stolen cart horse with improvised blanket padding, not a proper saddle
3. **Character dynamics rebalanced**: Adjusted Dax (16) and Alia (14) interactions to show proper age hierarchy with Dax taking more initiative and protective role

### Japanese Language Naturalness Improvements
1. **「確実に捕まったと思ったよ」** → **「本当に捕まるかと思った」**
   - More natural expression of fear/relief about nearly being caught
2. **「あなたがあまりにも長く行っていたから」** → **「あまりにも長く戻らなかったから」**
   - Corrected awkward grammar; "行っていた" (ongoing action) to "戻らなかった" (didn't return)
3. **「ブラックウォーターは死だ」** → **「ブラックウォーターは死の街だ」**
   - More natural Japanese phrasing; added "街" to make it sound less like direct translation
4. **「薄い空気の中に？」** → **「高地に？」**
   - Clarified context; "thin air" reference was unclear, changed to "high ground/altitude"
5. **「胸の奥で重みが宿った」** → **「胸に重みを感じた」**
   - More natural expression for feeling emotional weight/responsibility

### Character Relationship Corrections
1. **Opening scene**: Changed "アリアとダックス" to "ダックスとアリア" to establish proper order
2. **Dialogue rebalancing**: 
   - Alia's opening dialogue changed to Dax speaking first: "心配した" with Alia following quietly
   - Distance question changed from Alia asking to Dax asking while showing concern for his sister
3. **Age-appropriate behavior**: Enhanced Dax's protective instincts and leadership while showing Alia as following his lead
