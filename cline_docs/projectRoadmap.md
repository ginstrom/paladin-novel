## Completed Tasks

### Recent Major Revisions (2025-05-26)
- **CHAPTER OUTLINE SYNCHRONIZATION COMPLETED**: Comprehensive update of chapter-outline.md to match actual manuscript chapters. Fixed major discrepancies including Chapter 22 title ("An Unholy Alliance" → "The First Tithe of Tears"), Chapter 23 title and content ("The Long March" → "The Shadow of Gorlatch"), Chapter 24 title and expanded content ("Coastal Storm" → "The Cleansing Tide"), and Chapter 26 epilogue structure. All chapter descriptions now accurately reflect actual content, titles match, and narrative flow is properly documented. Part V chapter count corrected (22-25 → 22-26).
- **CHAPTER 25 CREATION ("The Wrath of Gods")**: New climactic chapter featuring the Battle of Citadel Asham-Val. Gond's army joins Thorek's dwarven forces to assault the corrupt Order of Turin stronghold. The chapter showcases Gond's spiritual growth culminating in Turin's divine wrath striking down the corrupt priests who perverted his teachings. Gond's holy power causes enemy soldiers to lay down weapons and seek forgiveness. The victory represents the final defeat of organized corruption and sets up the peaceful epilogue. Original Chapter 25 moved to Chapter 26.
- **CHAPTER 24 REWRITE ("The Cleansing Tide")**: Major rewrite detailing the liberation of three coastal slaver cities. Saltmere falls after a fierce military battle, with dwarven aid proving crucial and the Sunken Grotto reclaimed. Blackwater sees an internal rebellion during its siege, allowing Gond's forces to breach the walls and uncover a horrific temple to Gorlatch in the keep's dungeons. Port Sorrow, defended by elite clerics and three black ships, is taken after Gond unleashes a powerful divine light to break their fear magic; he then collapses but recovers to defeat the high priests in a divine duel (Alanyi vs. Gorlatch). The chapter ends with news of the dwarves besieging the inland Citadel of Asham-Val (a corrupt Order of Turin stronghold), and Gond resolving to march his army to their aid.
- **CHAPTER 23 REWRITE ("The Shadow of Gorlatch")**: Rewritten to include new conflicts during the march to Saltmere: mysterious disappearances, a skirmish highlighting inter-faction cooperation, and a major attack by Gorlatch's clerics testing Gond's divine powers. Details the army's arrival at Saltmere, the grim discovery of the missing persons (tortured by Gorlatch's followers), Gond's adherence to Alanyi's guidance in a critical healing moment, a treacherous delegation from Saltmere, and the establishment of a full siege, including a naval blockade. Continues to emphasize Gond's leadership and the sacred, multi-faceted nature of the war.
- **CHAPTER 22 REVISION ("The First Tithe of Tears")**: Rewritten to align with spiritual themes from Ch 21. War council plans attack on Saltmere, focusing on reclaiming Alanyi's Sunken Grotto temple. Reports from dwarven and elven fronts confirm their contributions to the three-pronged sacred campaign (securing shrines, disrupting Gorlatch's forces, purifying sites). Gond's leadership reflects divine purpose. Borin and Kael's presence in Saltmere revealed; Gond responds with spiritual maturity. Army prepares for march, imbued with sacred mission.
- **CHAPTER 21 REVISION ("A House Divided")**: Major thematic and religious restructuring. Established Turin as dominant worship with Alanyi's temples in ruins. Gond's charismatic leadership reaches peak with Alanyi speaking directly through him during council meeting. Goals shifted from modern liberty/egalitarianism to restoration of Alanyi's influence, mercy tempering Turin's justice, rebuilding temples, healing wounds. Sim chosen as leader of Alanyi's revival. Silviana aids human "Reformed Order" with lost knowledge and rites. Three-army coordination now explicitly focused on spiritual restoration alongside military objectives.
