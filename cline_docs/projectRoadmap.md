## Completed Tasks

### Project Reorganization (2025-05-27)
- **EBOOK PUBLISHING FORMAT REORGANIZATION COMPLETED**: Successfully restructured entire project to match recommended ebook publishing standards. Created `chapters/` directory with descriptive filenames (01_mark-of-betrayal.md through 27_epilogue.md). Renamed `assets/` to `images/` directory. Created `build/` directory for generated files and moved `epub-master.md` there. Moved `synopsis.md` to `cline_docs/` directory. Created `metadata.yml` with integrated book description from blurb content. Added `epub.css` stylesheet for ebook formatting. Removed empty `manuscript/` directory. New structure follows recommended format: chapters/, images/, build/, metadata.yml, epub.css. All 27 chapters successfully renamed with zero-padded numbering and descriptive titles. Project now ready for professional ebook generation and publishing workflows.

### Book Blurb Creation (2025-05-27)
- **BOOK JACKET BLURB COMPLETED**: Created professional marketing copy for "Paladin's Rise" in `manuscript/blurb.md` following comprehensive blurb-writing guidelines. Crafted compelling 147-word single-paragraph blurb incorporating all essential elements: arresting hook about betrayal and slave branding, core premise combining protagonist + goal + obstacle, cynical mercenary character introduction, main conflict between revenge and divine calling, continental stakes with corrupt temple system, unique selling point of mercy-based divine powers, and emotional promise about reluctant heroism. Maintained sardonic tone consistent with novel's voice while teasing only Act I material (betrayal, enslavement, escape, initial divine manifestations). Structured for maximum marketing impact with rhythmic pacing and compelling final question about divine justice. Blurb ready for publisher use and book marketing materials.

### Synopsis Update (2025-05-27)
- **COMPREHENSIVE SYNOPSIS REVISION**: Updated `manuscript/synopsis.md` to incorporate all major story developments from the completed 27-chapter narrative. Added Gorlatch conspiracy as underlying antagonistic force, spiritual restoration themes with Alanyi's direct divine manifestations, multi-racial alliance details (Iron Covenant dwarves, Circle of Whispers elves), divine sword evolution paralleling spiritual growth, Noble Knights schism with Sir Marcus Brightwater's faction, three-pronged War of Restoration campaign structure, and completed character arcs including Sim's spiritual leadership role. Enhanced world-building coverage of religious systems, continental resistance networks, and siege warfare capabilities. Maintained sardonic narrative voice while balancing personal transformation with political revolution themes. Synopsis now accurately reflects the full scope of the completed novel from Gond's betrayal and enslavement through his evolution into a legendary paladin leading a continental liberation movement that transforms the world through mercy, justice, and unity across racial boundaries.

### Timeline Continuity Fixes (2025-05-27)
- **TIMELINE DISCREPANCY RESOLUTION**: Implemented targeted fixes for four major timeline inconsistencies identified in comprehensive time continuity analysis (`rules/timeContinuity.md`). Fixed Chapter 8 winter preparation reference that conflicted with Chapter 9's summer setting by changing "prepare for winter" to "prepare for the coming seasons". Adjusted Chapter 16 Maera's travel timeframe from "six months" to "several months" to align with story progression. Corrected Chapter 22 settlement age reference from "six months ago" to "over a year ago" to match actual timeline. All fixes preserve narrative flow and emotional impact while ensuring consistent 18-month story span from mid-April Year 1 to fall Year 2. Seasonal anchor points maintained with Chapter 9 serving as fixed summer timing reference.

### Translation Documentation (2025-05-27)
- **TRANSLATION GUIDE CREATION**: Created comprehensive translation guide (`cline_docs/translationGuide.md`) for English-Japanese translation of "Paladin's Rise". Establishes best practices for maintaining sardonic tone, "show don't tell" narrative style, and dark fantasy atmosphere while adapting to Japanese literary conventions. Includes methodology phases, character voice guidelines, technical guidelines for names and terminology, quality assurance checklist, and continuous improvement framework. References existing glossary (`glossary-en-ja.md`) and translated Chapter 1 as style references.
- **CHAPTER 1 TRANSLATION IMPROVEMENT**: Applied comprehensive improvement methodology to Chapter 1 Japanese translation (`manuscript-ja/chapter-01_jp_rev.md`). Fixed critical terminology error (manacle mistranslation), compressed redundant phrasing by ~20%, improved natural Japanese flow with proper word order, maintained consistent 常体 narrative voice, and enhanced readability while preserving original atmosphere. Demonstrates practical application of translation guide principles.

### Recent Major Revisions (2025-05-26)
- **CHAPTER OUTLINE SYNCHRONIZATION COMPLETED**: Comprehensive update of chapter-outline.md to match actual manuscript chapters. Fixed major discrepancies including Chapter 22 title ("An Unholy Alliance" → "The First Tithe of Tears"), Chapter 23 title and content ("The Long March" → "The Shadow of Gorlatch"), Chapter 24 title and expanded content ("Coastal Storm" → "The Cleansing Tide"), and Chapter 26 epilogue structure. All chapter descriptions now accurately reflect actual content, titles match, and narrative flow is properly documented. Part V chapter count corrected (22-25 → 22-26).
- **CHAPTER 25 CREATION ("The Wrath of Gods")**: New climactic chapter featuring the Battle of Citadel Asham-Val. Gond's army joins Thorek's dwarven forces to assault the corrupt Order of Turin stronghold. The chapter showcases Gond's spiritual growth culminating in Turin's divine wrath striking down the corrupt priests who perverted his teachings. Gond's holy power causes enemy soldiers to lay down weapons and seek forgiveness. The victory represents the final defeat of organized corruption and sets up the peaceful epilogue. Original Chapter 25 moved to Chapter 26.
- **CHAPTER 24 REWRITE ("The Cleansing Tide")**: Major rewrite detailing the liberation of three coastal slaver cities. Saltmere falls after a fierce military battle, with dwarven aid proving crucial and the Sunken Grotto reclaimed. Blackwater sees an internal rebellion during its siege, allowing Gond's forces to breach the walls and uncover a horrific temple to Gorlatch in the keep's dungeons. Port Sorrow, defended by elite clerics and three black ships, is taken after Gond unleashes a powerful divine light to break their fear magic; he then collapses but recovers to defeat the high priests in a divine duel (Alanyi vs. Gorlatch). The chapter ends with news of the dwarves besieging the inland Citadel of Asham-Val (a corrupt Order of Turin stronghold), and Gond resolving to march his army to their aid.
- **CHAPTER 23 REWRITE ("The Shadow of Gorlatch")**: Rewritten to include new conflicts during the march to Saltmere: mysterious disappearances, a skirmish highlighting inter-faction cooperation, and a major attack by Gorlatch's clerics testing Gond's divine powers. Details the army's arrival at Saltmere, the grim discovery of the missing persons (tortured by Gorlatch's followers), Gond's adherence to Alanyi's guidance in a critical healing moment, a treacherous delegation from Saltmere, and the establishment of a full siege, including a naval blockade. Continues to emphasize Gond's leadership and the sacred, multi-faceted nature of the war.
- **CHAPTER 22 REVISION ("The First Tithe of Tears")**: Rewritten to align with spiritual themes from Ch 21. War council plans attack on Saltmere, focusing on reclaiming Alanyi's Sunken Grotto temple. Reports from dwarven and elven fronts confirm their contributions to the three-pronged sacred campaign (securing shrines, disrupting Gorlatch's forces, purifying sites). Gond's leadership reflects divine purpose. Borin and Kael's presence in Saltmere revealed; Gond responds with spiritual maturity. Army prepares for march, imbued with sacred mission.
- **CHAPTER 21 REVISION ("A House Divided")**: Major thematic and religious restructuring. Established Turin as dominant worship with Alanyi's temples in ruins. Gond's charismatic leadership reaches peak with Alanyi speaking directly through him during council meeting. Goals shifted from modern liberty/egalitarianism to restoration of Alanyi's influence, mercy tempering Turin's justice, rebuilding temples, healing wounds. Sim chosen as leader of Alanyi's revival. Silviana aids human "Reformed Order" with lost knowledge and rites. Three-army coordination now explicitly focused on spiritual restoration alongside military objectives.
