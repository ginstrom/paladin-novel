### Core Translation Principles

### Translation Methodology

#### Phase 1: Structural Analysis & Duplicate Detection
1. **Compare original and translation paragraph-by-paragraph** for gaps/duplicates
2. **Remove duplicate paragraphs** (keep the first occurrence, delete later ones)
3. **Identify missing content** and add translation as needed
4. **Verify structural consistency** between original and translation

#### Phase 2: Systematic Term & Symbol Replacement
1. **Replace all English quotation marks** "…" with Japanese brackets 「…」
2. **Convert dashes and italic markup** to natural Japanese punctuation
3. **Fix critical terminology errors** (e.g., manacle = 烙印/焼き印, not 刺青)
4. **Standardize all proper nouns** according to glossary entries
5. **Ensure consistent technical terms** throughout

#### Phase 3: Japanese Language Optimization
1. **Compress redundant phrasing** by 20-30% while preserving meaning
2. **Restructure sentences** to follow natural Japanese word order (subject → action → description)
3. **Improve metaphors and comparisons** for Japanese linguistic sensibilities
4. **Eliminate verbose direct translations** in favor of natural Japanese expressions
5. **Balance sentence length** for optimal reading rhythm

#### Phase 4: Cultural Localization
1. **Adapt animal and sensory metaphors** to fit Japanese cultural context
2. **Adjust physical descriptions** to flow naturally in Japanese
3. **Localize dialogue patterns** to match character types appropriately
4. **Ensure cultural concepts** are understandable to Japanese readers

#### Phase 5: Style Unification & Quality Control
1. **Maintain consistent 常体 (casual form)** for narrative voice
2. **Limit comma usage** to maximum 2 per sentence for readability
3. **Balance kanji and hiragana** appropriately
4. **Eliminate awkward phrase repetitions**
5. **Ensure proper particle usage** throughout

#### Phase 6: Final Review & Correction
1. **Perform audio reading test** for natural flow
2. **Check for particle errors** and grammatical inconsistencies
3. **Verify tone consistency** throughout the chapter
4. **Confirm all terminology** matches glossary entries
5. **Final proofreading** for typos and formatting

### Character Voice Guidelines

#### Speech Patterns by Character Type
- **Guards/Slavers**: Rough, casual speech (だ/である調) with crude expressions
- **Gond**: Internal monologue in literary style, external speech varies by situation
- **Fellow Slaves**: Varied speech reflecting backgrounds and desperation
- **Authority Figures**: Formal speech patterns (です/ます調) when appropriate

#### Internal Monologue
- Use Japanese literary conventions for thoughts
- Employ appropriate sentence endings (だろう, のだ, etc.)
- Maintain sardonic tone through word choice and rhythm

### Technical Guidelines

#### Character Names
- **Fantasy names**: Use katakana (ゴンド, ペル, シム, etc.)
- **Maintain consistency** with established glossary entries
- **Consider pronunciation** when creating new name translations

#### Place Names
- **Adapt to natural Japanese equivalents** where possible (跳ね馬亭 for Prancing Dragon)
- **Use katakana for foreign-sounding locations** when adaptation isn't natural
- **Maintain geographical consistency** throughout the series

#### Religious and Cultural Terms
- **Establish consistent translations** for religious concepts
- **Use appropriate honorifics** for deities and religious figures
- **Adapt cultural concepts** to be understandable to Japanese readers

#### Critical Terminology Corrections
- **Manacle/Brand**: Always use 烙印 or 焼き印, never 刺青 (tattoo)
- **Hold**: 船倉 (ship's hold)
- **Cargo**: 積荷 (when referring to slaves dehumanizingly)
- **Overseers**: 監督官 (mine supervisors)

### Specific Translation Challenges

### Compression Techniques

#### Redundancy Elimination
- **Combine repetitive descriptive phrases** into single, more impactful expressions
- **Remove unnecessary explanatory text** that Japanese readers can infer
- **Streamline verbose passages** while preserving essential meaning
- **Consolidate similar actions** described multiple ways

#### Natural Japanese Flow
- **Use present tense for immediate actions** and past tense for completed events
- **Employ Japanese sentence connectors** (が, けれど, しかし) appropriately
- **Utilize Japanese literary devices** like onomatopoeia where suitable
- **Maintain proper rhythm** through varied sentence lengths
