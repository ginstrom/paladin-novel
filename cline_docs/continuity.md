## Divine System and Religious Orders

### Pantheon of Gods

#### Alanyi
- **Domains**: Healing and joy
- **Symbol**: Intertwined circles
- **Role**: Primary divine patron of Gond's paladin calling
- **Manifestation**: Speaks through Gond at critical moments, causing his face to glow with otherworldly light. Her symbol (intertwined circles) can momentarily appear on Gond's brow, replacing the slave brand, visible to those with spiritual sensitivity (Ch 19 during discussion with Sir Roderick, seen by Sim & Silviana; Ch 20 during healing of shadow-touched elf, seen by Silviana, Aelindra, and the healed elf; Ch 21 direct speech through Gond during council meeting about restoration goals, witnessed by entire diverse assembly).

### Divine Magic System

#### Healing Power Mechanics
- **Nature**: **NOT FINITE** - Healing power draws from healer's reserves but these reserves replenish over time
- **Sustainability**: Unlike finite magical systems, divine healing can be performed repeatedly as reserves naturally restore
- **Key limitations**:
  - **Capacity of the healer**: Individual skill, experience, and spiritual development level
  - **Will of the god**: Divine permission, instruction, or prohibition
  - **Connection of patient to the god**: Faith, worthiness, spiritual receptivity

#### Divine Intervention and Consequences
- **Divine control**: Gods may forbid healing or instruct healer to stop partway through treatment
- **Defiance consequences**: Healer may ignore divine instruction and pour out all energy in defiance of deity
- **Risks of defiance**: Severe self-harm, death, or becoming "fallen" (losing divine connection)
- **Spiritual balance**: Divine healing requires harmony between healer's will and divine purpose

### Paladin Powers and Development

- **Deity influence**: Some powers more common depending on patron deity (e.g., fear removal for Alanyi paladins)
- **Development**: Powers grow through spiritual development and as rewards for great deeds

- **Chapter 11+**: Brand visibly fading as divine power grows, "more shadow than scar"
- **Progressive transformation**: Over time, brand fades completely

#### Moonlight Manifestation
- **Special visibility**: Under moonlight, mark appears as faintly glowing silvery lines on Gond's forehead

## Character Developments

### Pell's Character Growth Arc
- **Background**: Former fishing boat worker from Millhaven, turned to "more profitable work"
- **Coast knowledge**: Provides strategic advantage in escape planning
- **Early chapters**: "Coins over conscience" attitude, materialistic focus
- **Chapter 4**: Excited about "good haul" from slaver ambush, counting coins
- **Chapter 19**: **Pivotal growth & loyalty moment** - Approached by Sir Roderick's squire (Alaric) with offer of gold for intelligence. Accepts initial payment, feigning consideration, but immediately brings the offer and gold to Gond and the council. Agrees to act as a channel for selective information. This demonstrates his loyalty and repurposing of his old skills for the cause, moving beyond simple refusal of blood money to active participation in counter-intelligence.
- **Character transformation**: From "coin over conscience, profit over principle" to "Some things aren't for sale" and active agent for the liberation.
- **New values**: "These people aren't just my allies—they're my family. And I don't sell out family." Utilizes past cunning for the group's benefit.

- **Internal conflict**: "The minimum necessary. But that doesn't make it easier"
- **Character consistency**: Refuses to participate in offensive operations, maintains healing/support role
- **Chapter 21**: **New Leadership Role** - Chosen by Gond (following Alanyi's divine manifestation) to lead the revival of Alanyi's worship. Tasked with creating spaces where her worship can flourish organically, rebuilding ruined temples, training new priests, but always offering hope rather than demanding faith.
