    *   Unique plants or creatures

**Example:**
*   **Deities & Religion:**
    *   **Alanyi:** Goddess of peace, light, justice, and redemption. Also known as the goddess of mercy. Worshipped by Sim. Her followers are sometimes ridiculed, and temples mostly destroyed (per outline for Ch 10). Sim mentions an Alanyite shrine in Darach (Chapter 3). Ancient elven followers withdrew from human contact when her influence waned but return when Gond's divine calling emerges. Silviana represents the Moonwood Circle, ancient elven keepers of Alanyi's traditions. 200 years ago, Paladins of Alanyi fought evil side by side with Battlemasters of Turin in the original Marshal Order.
    *   **Turin:** God of justice and protector of the weak. Worshipped by dwarven Iron Covenant and originally by the Marshal Order. 200 years ago, when Alanyi's influence waned and slavery rose, human leaders of the Marshal Order corrupted Turin's teachings, interpreting "justice" as enforcing human laws (including slavery). The dwarves broke away to preserve Turin's true teachings, forming the Iron Covenant. Turin's divine wrath will ultimately strike down the corrupt human leaders who perverted his teachings.
*   **Cultures & Factions:**
    *   **Slave Mark:** A recognized brand (two intertwined manacles) indicating enslaved status. Known by "every free man and woman on the coast." (Chapter 1). Wanted posters feature it.
    *   **Mercenaries:** Groups like Gond's former company operate, sometimes betraying their own for "business."
    *   **Slavers:** Organized groups that capture, transport, and sell slaves. Utilize slave ships and overland carts.
    *   **The Iron Covenant (Dwarves):** Martial holy order dedicated to protecting the innocent through righteous warfare. Formed 200 years ago when dwarves broke away from the corrupt Marshal Order to preserve Turin's true teachings. Honor-bound culture with forge-prayers (weapons blessed through religious smithing rituals). Operate from mountain strongholds that serve as secure bases and weapon manufacturing centers. Among the first to defect to Gond's cause due to alignment with their justice-focused beliefs and recognition of the ancient alliance between Alanyi and Turin.
    *   **The Marshal Order (Corrupt Human Leadership):** Originally served both Alanyi and Turin, with Paladins of Alanyi and Battlemasters of Turin fighting evil side by side. 200 years ago, human leaders corrupted the order's mission, interpreting "justice" as enforcing human laws (including slavery). Based in the Holy City of Turin. Will face Turin's divine wrath for perverting his teachings.
    *   **The Noble Knights of Turin (Human Defectors):** Drawn from nobility, these knights oppose slavery but maintain classist attitudes toward peasants. Do not formally break from the Marshal Order until the rebellion is in full swing. Focus on overthrowing the corrupt rulers of Turin rather than freeing slave cities. Form their own army that coordinates with Gond's movement but maintains separate command structure.
    *   **The Withdrawn (Elves):** Ancient followers of Alanyi who imposed self-exile from human affairs when the goddess's influence waned. Known as Keepers of the Old Ways, preserving Alanyi's original teachings in sacred groves where her power remains strong. Practice "The Watching" - observing human affairs from afar. Return to support Gond when his divine calling signals Alanyi's resurgence. Silviana represents the Moonwood Circle.
*   **Geography:**
    *   **Darach:** A walled city, a significant port or hub. Has a northern gate. Market square. Seems to be a center for slaver activity and where Borin & Kael operate. (Chapter 3, 5)
    *   **Cliffmere:** Location mentioned by Gond as his supposed origin when entering Darach. (Chapter 5)
    *   **Coastal Region:** Features cliffs, beaches, gullies, streams. (Chapter 3, 4)
    *   **Pilgrim Way-stations:** Exist, possibly offering shelter or supplies. Maera directs the group to one. (Chapter 3, 4, 5)
    *   **The Hills:** Remote, rugged areas inland, considered safer from slavers. (Chapter 5)
    *   **The Valley Settlement:** Secluded valley where Gond's community has established itself. Features stream with smithy, gardens, shelters built from salvaged materials. (Chapter 11)
    *   **The Holy City of Turin:** Major stronghold and seat of power for the corrupt Marshal Order. Center of the perverted teachings that interpret "justice" as enforcing human laws including slavery. Target for the climactic assault where Turin's divine wrath will strike down the corrupt leadership.
*   **Flora & Fauna:**
    *   **Herbs:** Maera uses a pungent, soothing salve for Gond's brand (Chapter 3). Sim identifies fleabane, thrift (near streams), and edible sea-kale (Chapter 3). Lavender (Chapter 4).
    *   **Animals:** Goats (Maera has one, Ch 3). Horses (used by slavers, two acquired by Gond's group, Ch 4; Ash used by Gond, Ch 5). Gulls (Ch 4).
