Integration challenges with knights' ingrained assumptions about justice versus mercy. **Alanyi's divine manifestation** - speaks directly through Gond during council meeting, witnessed by entire diverse assembly. **Spiritual restoration goals** established - shift from modern liberty/egalitarianism to restoration of Alanyi's influence, mercy tempering Turin's justice. **Sim chosen as spiritual leader** to lead Alanyi's revival, rebuild temples, train new priests. **Silviana aids Reformed Order** with ancient elven knowledge to restore lost rites and practices. **Three-army coordination planned** with explicit spiritual restoration objectives alongside military goals.

Army advances to Port Sorrow, finding it defended by elite Gorlatch clerics and three black ships. Clerics unleash powerful fear magic. Gond counters with an immense wave of divine light from his sword, shattering the fear and destroying the black ships, but collapses from the effort. After recovering, he confronts the high priests in their barricaded temple, defeating them in a divine duel (Alanyi vs. Gorlatch). The dark temple implodes. **Kael's redemption** - Gond discovers his former friend wounded and dying among enemy fighters, chooses divine mercy and heals him. Weeks later, a messenger from Thorek Ironheart reports the dwarves have besieged the Citadel of Asham-Val (corrupt Order of Turin stronghold) and requests aid. Gond agrees to march his army inland.

- **Chapter 22**: Verified "Over a year ago, this settlement didn't exist" - correctly reflects settlement age
- **Chapter 9**: No changes needed (serves as summer timing anchor point)

### Chapter Title Corrections (2025-05-27)

- **Chapter 4**: Excited about "good haul" from slaver ambush, counting coins
- **Chapter 19**: **Pivotal growth & loyalty moment** - Approached by Sir Roderick's squire (Alaric) with offer of gold for intelligence. Accepts initial payment, feigning consideration, but immediately brings the offer and gold to Gond and the council. Agrees to act as a channel for selective information. This demonstrates his loyalty and repurposing of his old skills for the cause, moving beyond simple refusal of blood money to active participation in counter-intelligence.
