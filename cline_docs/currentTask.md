## Current Objective
Create a compelling book-jacket blurb for "Paladin's Rise" based on the comprehensive synopsis in manuscript/synopsis.md, following the detailed blurb-writing guidelines provided by the user.

## Context
The user has requested a professional book-jacket blurb that will serve as marketing copy for the completed epic fantasy novel "Paladin's Rise." The blurb must follow specific guidelines:
- 120-150 words maximum
- Single paragraph format
- Hook + premise + protagonist + conflict + stakes + unique twist + emotional promise
- Tease only Act I material (no spoilers beyond opening)
- Match the book's sardonic tone
- End with compelling question/promise

## Key Story Elements to Incorporate
From the synopsis, the essential elements for the blurb are:
- **Hook**: Betrayed mercenary's transformation from cynic to paladin
- **Premise**: Gond betrayed by comrades, enslaved, escapes, discovers divine calling
- **Protagonist**: Cynical mercenary with unexpected capacity for mercy
- **Conflict**: Personal revenge vs. divine mission to liberate the enslaved
- **Stakes**: Continental slave system vs. freedom for all races
- **Unique Twist**: Divine powers manifesting through mercy rather than violence
- **Tone**: Sardonic epic fantasy with redemption themes

## Next Steps
1. Create manuscript/blurb.md with compelling book-jacket copy
2. Follow the 10-point guideline structure provided
3. Maintain sardonic tone consistent with the novel
4. Focus on Act I material only (betrayal, enslavement, escape, initial divine awakening)
5. Target 120-150 words in single paragraph format
6. Update projectRoadmap.md with completed task
