## Current Objective
Translate Chapter 15 "Burden of Grace" (chapters/15_burden-of-grace.md) from English to Japanese following the established translation methodology and quality standards.

## Context
This is the next chapter in the ongoing Japanese translation project for "Paladin's Rise" (聖騎士の目覚め). Chapters 1-14 have been completed with professional Japanese novel standards. Chapter 15 is a pivotal chapter featuring:
- Aftermath of battle with casualties (Willem, Sif, others)
- Gond's spiritual crisis when divine guidance conflicts with his desire to save everyone
- Introduction of Thorek Ironheart and the Iron Covenant (dwarf alliance)
- Transition from defensive to offensive strategy
- Establishment of war council and preparation for larger conflict

## Target Quality
- Professional Japanese novel standard (5/5 naturalness rating)
- Maintain perfect accuracy to source material (5/5 accuracy)
- Follow "show don't tell" principles
- Cultural adaptation for Japanese readers
- 20-30% compression from literal translation

## Implementation Plan
1. Apply 6-phase translation methodology from translationGuide.md
