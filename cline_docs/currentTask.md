## Current Objective
Apply literary improvements to Chapter 14 Japanese translation (manuscript-ja/14_legend-begins.md) based on detailed user feedback to elevate it from good translation quality to professional Japanese novel standards.

## Context
The user provided comprehensive feedback on five key areas for improvement:
1. Title enhancement (consider 伝説の幕開け or 伝説が始まるとき)
2. Eliminate repetitive expressions (重くのしかかる, 覚悟を決めた)
3. Enhance flat/expository phrasing with more poetic alternatives
4. Improve literal translations of idioms for natural dialogue
5. Unify divine light descriptions with consistent terminology

## Target Quality
Transform the translation from faithful but mechanical to prose that reads as if originally written by a skilled Japanese fantasy novelist, while maintaining perfect accuracy to the source material.

## Implementation Plan
1. Review and enhance chapter title
2. Systematically improve repetitive expressions with poetic alternatives
3. Elevate flat phrasing to more literary Japanese
4. Naturalize dialogue and idiomatic expressions
5. Establish consistent divine imagery terminology
6. Ensure all changes follow project "show don't tell" principles
7. Update translation notes with improvements made
