## Current Objective
Flesh out Chapter 5 to add suspense and danger, with Gond postponing his plans for revenge and making a dangerous escape from Blackwater.

## Context
Chapter 5 ("A Change of Course") currently shows Gond's first unconscious shift from self-focused mercenary to protector-leader. The user wants to enhance this with more suspense and specific plot elements that force Gond to abandon his personal mission and focus on protecting his group.

## Specific Requirements
1. **Enhanced danger in Blackwater**: More suspicious guards, close calls, people recognizing him
2. **Forced abandonment of horse**: Gond must leave Ash behind due to circumstances
3. **Nightfall escape**: Wait for darkness and scale the city walls to escape
4. **Vulnerable return journey**: Walk back to waypoint on foot, showing increased danger
5. **Threat explanation**: Make clear that slavers are actively hunting the group
6. **Resource constraints**: Only one horse remaining for the group
7. **Character development**: Reinforce Gond's transformation from revenge-seeker to protector

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dangerous Infiltration
- Make gate guards more suspicious and thorough
- Add close calls with recognition in the city
- Show escalating danger as more people notice him
- Force Gond to abandon his horse due to pursuit/circumstances

### Phase 2: Nightfall Escape Sequence
- Gond trapped in the city, must wait for darkness
- Tense hiding sequence during the day
- Dramatic wall-scaling escape at night
- Show physical and emotional cost of the escape

### Phase 3: Vulnerable Return
- Long walk back to waypoint on foot
- Increased vulnerability without horse
- Encounters that show the danger level has escalated
- Rescue of Lira during the return journey

### Phase 4: Group Dynamics
- Explain the heightened threat to the group
- Show resource constraints with only one horse
- Demonstrate Gond's shift to protector mindset
- Set up need for better hiding place

## Narrative Guidelines
- Maintain "show, don't tell" principles throughout
- Use concrete actions and sensory details
- Keep Gond's sardonic voice even in dangerous moments
- Show character growth through actions, not exposition
- Build suspense through escalating stakes
- Use physical details to convey emotional states

## Character Development Focus
- Gond's unconscious shift from personal revenge to group protection
- Show leadership emerging through crisis management
- Demonstrate tactical thinking under pressure
- Reveal growing sense of responsibility for others
- Maintain his irreverent personality while showing growth
