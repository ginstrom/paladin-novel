## Current Objective
Conduct an overall review of the story for credibility in timing, specifically looking for messengers arriving with too-perfect timing or attackers appearing with unrealistically short warning. Implement minor clarifications to enhance realism where needed.

## Context
Reviewed Memory Bank files (`timeContinuity.md`, `currentTask.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`, `projectRoadmap.md`). Searched all chapters for relevant scenes. Analyzed key chapters (14, 18, 21) for timing credibility.

**Previous Task (Dialogue Revision):**
Successfully revised dialogue in:
- `chapters/11_first-blood-first-miracle.md`
- `chapters/02_breaking-chains.md`
- `chapters/04_crack-in-the-chain.md`
- `chapters/10_hunters-and-hunted.md`
- `chapters/15_burden-of-grace.md`
- `chapters/19_tide-turns.md`
- `chapters/25_cleansing-tide.md`
- `chapters/24_shadow-of-gorlatch.md`
- `chapters/26_wrath-of-gods.md`
- `chapters/27_continent-reborn.md`
User feedback on the style of revisions has been incorporated. `cline_docs/authoringGuidelines.md` and `cline_docs/characters.md` have been updated. User confirmed satisfaction with Gond's evolving tone and overall progress.

## Plan for Timing Credibility Audit
1.  **Chapter 14 ("The Legend Begins") Clarification:** Add a brief line to explain the short final warning before the slaver attack.
2.  **Chapter 18 ("First Stand") Clarification:** Add a line to explain the short notice (hours) before the professional army's attack.
3.  **Documentation Update (`timeContinuity.md`):** Add a section summarizing this timing credibility audit, its findings, and the rationale for any changes made.
4.  **Documentation Update (`projectRoadmap.md`):** Mark the timing credibility audit task as complete.
5.  **Documentation Update (`codebaseSummary.md`):** Note the timing credibility review and minor chapter revisions.
6.  Present the completed work to the user.

## Next Steps
1.  Implement clarification in `chapters/14_legend-begins.md`.
