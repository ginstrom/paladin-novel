## Current Objective
Clean up the hyphen-changes-list.md document by removing entries that are already correct, leaving only the necessary changes that need to be made.

## Context
The user requested to go through the hyphen-changes-list.md document and remove dash uses that are already correct, keeping only the instances that actually require changes. The original document contained many entries marked as "Already correct" or "No change needed" which were cluttering the list.

## Task Scope
- Review the comprehensive hyphen-changes-list.md document
- Remove all entries marked as "Already correct (has em-dash)"
- Remove chapters with "No changes needed"
- Remove entries that say "No change needed"
- Keep only actual changes that need to be implemented
- Maintain clear documentation of what changes are required

## Progress
- ✅ Analyzed the original hyphen-changes-list.md document
- ✅ Identified entries that were already correct
- ✅ Cleaned up the document to show only necessary changes
- ✅ Reduced from ~152 original entries to 45 actual changes needed
- ✅ Updated summary to reflect accurate change count

## Next Steps
1. Document is now clean and ready for implementation
2. Can proceed with actual hyphen-to-em-dash replacements in chapter files
3. Use the cleaned list as reference for systematic chapter updates
4. Focus on the 45 identified instances that need changes
