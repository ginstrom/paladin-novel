## Current Objective
Fix EPUB table of contents (TOC) numbering. Even with `--number-sections=false` in the Pandoc command, the TOC still displays numbers. This will be addressed by adding a CSS rule to `epub.css` to explicitly hide list numbering in the TOC.

## Context
The user reported that the TOC in the generated EPUB (`build/paladins-rise.epub`) is still numbered, despite the Pandoc command in the `Makefile` using `--number-sections=false`.
Previous attempts to fix this by only modifying the Pandoc command were insufficient.
The `projectRoadmap.md` and `codebaseSummary.md` both note a previous attempt on 2025-05-30 to fix this issue via Makefile changes.

Memory Bank files read:
- `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`
- `cline_docs/currentTask.md` (previous state)
- `cline_docs/techStack.md`
- `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`
- `Makefile`

## Plan & Execution
1.  **Modify `epub.css`**: Added CSS rules to hide numbering in the TOC. **[COMPLETED]**
    ```css
    /* Suppress TOC numbering */
    nav[epub|type~="toc"] ol {
      list-style-type: none;
      margin-left: 0;
      padding-left: 1em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */
    }

    /* Fallback for older readers or different TOC structures */
    ol.toc, .toc ol {
      list-style-type: none;
      margin-left: 0;
      padding-left: 1em; /* Adjust as needed for indentation */
    }
    ```
2.  **Rebuild EPUB**: Ran `make` to regenerate `build/paladins-rise.epub`. **[COMPLETED]**
3.  **Verify Fix**: User will check the TOC in their EPUB reader. **[PENDING USER VERIFICATION]**
4.  **Update Documentation**:
    - Update `cline_docs/currentTask.md` to reflect completion. **[COMPLETED]**
    - Update `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` to note the successful fix. **[PENDING]**
    - Update `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md` with this change. **[PENDING]**
5.  **Attempt Completion**: Present the result to the user. **[PENDING]**

## Next Steps
1. Update `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`.
