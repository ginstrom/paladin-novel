- [x] Add physical details of Marcus's injuries during granddaughter tale (hands shaking, raw blisters on palms from walking with improvised staff, voice cracking with exhaustion)

- [x] Show Thorek's smith expertise through specific observations about the blade (added detailed examination: "weathered hands traced the blade's surface with the delicate touch of someone who understood metal at its most fundamental level. He held it up to catch the light, squinted at the grain of the steel, even brought it close to his ear and tapped it gently with one thick finger, listening to the tone it produced" and expert analysis: "The steel is too pure, the balance too perfect. The edge holds a sharpness that should be impossible to maintain. And the way it resonates when struck—it sings with harmonics I've never heard from earthly metal")
- [x] Add ceremonial elements to the alliance formation hand-clasp (added ritual significance: "As their hands met, Thorek spoke a phrase in the old dwarven tongue, his voice carrying the weight of ritual and ceremony.

- [x] Describe specific mechanical details of the siege engine (added comprehensive description: "The machine stood nearly twice the height of a man, its throwing arm crafted from laminated wood strips bound with iron bands. Counterweight stones hung in a mesh of chains and pulleys, while the frame itself was inscribed with dwarven runes that seemed to pulse with their own inner light" and "the intricate mechanism of the release trigger, the precisely calculated angles of the throwing arm, the massive windlass system that would cock the weapon for firing")
- [x] Make Grandmother Nessa's death scene more poignant with sensory details (enhanced with: "The scent of sickness hung in the air—that particular mixture of fever sweat and something deeper, more final", "Her breath came in shallow whispers, each exhalation carrying the faint rattle of fluid in her lungs", "The scent of sickness faded, replaced by something cleaner—like wildflowers after rain", "The night air seemed to still around them, as if the world itself was holding its breath", "The scent of wildflowers lingered for a moment longer, then faded into the cool night air")
