## Current Objective
Add cover image link to README.md above "Using the Makefile" section

## Context
User requested to add an image link to 'images/cover.png' in the README.md file, positioned above the "Using the Makefile" section. The README.md file already exists with comprehensive project documentation.

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ Read Memory Bank files (projectRoadmap.md, currentTask.md, techStack.md, codebaseSummary.md)
2. ✅ Read existing README.md file to understand structure
3. ✅ Added cover image link `![Cover](images/cover.png)` above "Using the Makefile" section
4. ✅ Updated currentTask.md to reflect completion

## Files Updated
- ✅ README.md (added cover image link)
- ✅ cline_docs/currentTask.md (this file)

## Quality Standards Met
- Proper markdown image syntax used
- Image positioned correctly above Makefile section
- Maintains existing README structure and formatting
- Uses relative path to images/cover.png as requested
