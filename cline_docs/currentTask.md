## Current Objective
Ellipsis consistency rule established in documentation. User will implement the specific file changes for Chapter 6 "聖域への道" continuity issues and Japanese language naturalness problems based on manual corrections and feedback.

## Context
User requested consistent use of ellipsis character (…) instead of three dots (...) throughout the project. Additionally, user manually fixed several continuity issues in Chapter 6 and identified specific Japanese language problems that need correction. The chapter had plot inconsistencies and unnatural Japanese expressions that require systematic correction.

## Specific Issues to Address

### 1. Continuity Corrections
- **Remove all merchant references**: Eliminate the noon smoke passage that mentions merchant party
- **Fix horse/saddle description**: Change from "makeshift saddle" to improvised blanket padding since it's a stolen cart horse
- **Correct character dynamics**: Dax (16) should show more agency than Alia (14), not the reverse

### 2. Japanese Language Naturalness Issues
- **「確実に捕まったと思ったよ」** → More natural expression needed
- **「あなたがあまりにも長く行っていたから」** → Grammatically awkward, needs correction
- **「薄い空気の中に？」** → Unclear in context, needs clarification
- **「ブラックウォーターは死だ」** → Too literal, needs more natural Japanese
- **「胸の奥で重みが宿った」** → Slightly unnatural phrasing

### 3. Character Relationship Corrections
- **Dax/Alia dynamic**: Current text has Alia speaking more and being more assertive
- **Age-appropriate behavior**: Dax (16) should be more protective and take more initiative
- **Dialogue distribution**: Rebalance to show proper sibling hierarchy

## Specific Passages Requiring Correction

### Merchant Smoke Reference (Remove Entirely)
Current: 「正午に来た。彼らが来た方向から煙が立ち上った——キャンプファイア。方向と距離からゴンドは彼らが宿駅にいると推測した。」

### Horse Description
Current: 「間に合わせの鞍の上で居眠りして」
Target: 「毛布を敷いた馬の背で居眠りして」

### Character Dialogue and Actions
Review all Alia/Dax interactions to ensure proper age dynamics

## Implementation Strategy
1. ✅ Establish ellipsis consistency rule in project documentation
2. 🔄 User implementing: Apply ellipsis consistency across all project files
3. 🔄 User implementing: Systematically locate and fix all continuity issues in Chapter 6
4. 🔄 User implementing: Correct Japanese language naturalness problems
5. 🔄 User implementing: Rebalance Dax/Alia character dynamics
6. 🔄 User implementing: Maintain existing translation quality and consistency
7. 🔄 User implementing: Update translation notes with all corrections

## Success Criteria
- All continuity issues resolved
- Natural Japanese expressions throughout
- Proper character age dynamics reflected
- Maintained translation accuracy and consistency
- Enhanced readability and flow

## Previous Context
Chapter 6 translation was completed with 5-star quality ratings, but user identified specific continuity breaks and language issues requiring correction.
