## Current Objective
✅ COMPLETED: Successfully tightened and simplified revision history text in documentation files, reducing verbosity while maintaining essential information.

## Context
Streamlined verbose revision histories in projectRoadmap.md and codebaseSummary.md to focus on key accomplishments and outcomes rather than exhaustive process details.

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ **projectRoadmap.md**: Condensed verbose Japanese translation entries from detailed multi-paragraph descriptions to concise single-line summaries
   - Chapter 10: Reduced from 200+ words to 25 words

   - Chapter 8: Reduced from 300+ words to 25 words
   - Chapters 7-2: Similar reductions applied

2. ✅ **codebaseSummary.md**: Simplified "Recent Significant Changes" section
   - Condensed 7 verbose entries into 5 concise bullet points
   - Maintained essential information while eliminating redundant details

## Results
