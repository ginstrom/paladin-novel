## Current Objective
✅ COMPLETED: Fixed continuity issues with siblings Alia and Dax throughout the manuscript

## Context
User identified major character name inconsistency where Alia (14-year-old sister of Dax) was being confused with Aerin (separate refugee character). This created continuity problems with the sibling relationship and character development.

## Character Specifications
- **Alia**: younger sister, age 14, traumatized
- **Dax**: older brother, age 16, trained as carpenter's apprentice, initially has injured feet
- Both were captured by raiders who murdered the rest of their family, then sold to slavers
- Were on their way to slave market in Blackwater when rescued in Chapter 4

## Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **Chapter 6**: Fixed "Aerin asked, unconsciously moving closer to her brother" → "Alia asked, unconsciously moving closer to her brother"
2. ✅ **Chapter 6**: Fixed "They're destroying everything," Aerin whispered" → "They're destroying everything," Alia whispered"
3. ✅ **Chapter 8**: Fixed "Aerin's mouth closed with an audible snap" → "Alia's mouth closed with an audible snap"
4. ✅ **Chapter 8**: Fixed "Aerin's gaze shifted to Sim" → "Alia's gaze shifted to Sim"
5. ✅ **Chapter 9**: Fixed "Aerin and Dax, energized by safety, took charge of foraging" → "Alia and Dax" (siblings working together)
6. ✅ **Chapter 11**: Fixed "Aerin knelt beside her brother, her tears falling onto his blood-stained face" → "Alia knelt beside her brother" (critical healing scene)
7. ✅ **Chapter 11**: Fixed "Aerin looked up, her face streaked with tears" → "Alia looked up, her face streaked with tears"
8. ✅ **Chapter 18**: Fixed "Aerin and Dax helped distribute bolts and arrows" → "Alia and Dax helped distribute bolts and arrows"

## Resolution Summary
- **Total corrections made**: 8 instances across 5 chapters
- **Characters clarified**: Alia (Dax's sister) vs Aerin (separate refugee character)
- **Sibling relationship consistency**: Now properly maintained throughout manuscript
- **Character roles preserved**: Both Alia and Aerin maintain their distinct identities and story functions

## Verification
- ✅ Searched for remaining "Aerin" instances - no further corrections needed
- ✅ All sibling references now correctly use "Alia" as Dax's sister
- ✅ Aerin remains as separate character with her own story arc
- ✅ Character specifications match user requirements (ages, backgrounds, trauma history)

## Impact
The continuity fixes ensure that:
- Alia is consistently portrayed as Dax's traumatized 14-year-old sister throughout the story
- The sibling bond and protective relationship is properly maintained
- Key emotional scenes (especially Dax's healing miracle in Chapter 11) have correct family dynamics
- Reader understanding of character relationships is clear and consistent
