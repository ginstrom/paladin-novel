## Current Objective
Rewrite Chapter 21 of "The Reluctant Paladin" based on significant thematic and religious changes.

## Context
The revision aims to:
- Establish Turin as the dominant worship on the continent, with Alanyi's temples mostly in ruins
- Reflect Gond's growing charismatic and inspiring leadership reaching its peak
- Have Alanyi speak through Gond at a pivotal moment
- Shift goals from modern concepts of liberty/egalitarianism to restoration of Alanyi's influence, mercy tempering Turin's justice, rebuilding temples, healing wounds physical and spiritual
- Establish Sim as the chosen leader of Alanyi's revival, focusing on allowing worship to flourish rather than compelling it
- Have Silviana help the human "Reformed Order" (of Alanyi) restore lost knowledge and rites

## Detailed Plan

**I. Opening: Noble Knight Defectors Arrival**
- Keep Sir Marcus Brightwater and his knights arriving, disillusioned with Sir Roderick's hypocrisy
- Shift integration tension from egalitarian vs. hierarchy to purpose of their fight
- Sir Marcus's knights initially driven by Turin-esque justice; Gond guides them toward Alanyi's restoration vision

**II. Mid-Chapter: Religious Landscape & Peak Divine Manifestation**
- **Turin Dominance/Alanyi in Ruins:** Emphasize temples declaring for Gond are forgotten/ruined Alanyi shrines being reclaimed
- **Gond's Charisma Peaks - Alanyi Speaks Through Him:**
  - Context: Council meeting discussing new broader goals, addressing diverse group including defectors
  - Manifestation: Gond's voice changes, becomes resonant with divine wisdom - clearly Alanyi speaking through him
  - Content: Alanyi speaks of her diminished influence, need for mercy to temper Turin's justice, rebuilding temples, healing wounds
  - Effect: Awe, tears, renewed conviction in all listeners
- **Sim Chosen as Leader of Alanyi's Revival:**
  - Following divine manifestation, Gond recognizes Sim's quiet strength and faith
  - Charges Sim with overseeing spiritual revival - nurturing spaces where Alanyi's worship can flourish organically
- **Silviana's Role with Reformed Order:**
  - "Reformed Order" reframed as nascent Alanyi-focused organization
  - Silviana offers to help restore lost rites and theological knowledge

**III. Gorlatch Connection & Redefined Goals**
- Maintain revelation about Gorlatch's corruption plan
- Fight becomes explicitly about restoring divine balance - Alanyi's mercy tempering Turin's justice
- Three-army coordination goals reflect spiritual dimension: liberating lands for Alanyi's return, healing spiritual sickness

**IV. Concluding Scene**
- Focus on profound spiritual purpose rather than political freedom/equality
- Gond feels deeper connection to goddess and followers
- War preparations imbued with sacred duty for spiritual renewal
