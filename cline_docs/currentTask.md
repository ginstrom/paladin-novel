## Current Objective
Ensure that the chapter outline for chapters 1-11 matches the actual story content that has been written. This involves comparing the chapter-outline.md descriptions with the actual manuscript chapters to identify any discrepancies and update the outline accordingly.

## Context
The project has completed chapters 1-11 of "The Reluctant Paladin" manuscript. The chapter outline serves as the master reference document for chapter content, but it needs to be verified against the actual written chapters to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Key Areas to Verify
1. Chapter titles match between outline and manuscript files
2. Chapter summaries in outline accurately reflect actual chapter content
3. Character developments described in outline align with what's written
4. Plot points and events match between outline and chapters
5. Themes and tone descriptions are consistent
6. Any missing elements in outline that appear in actual chapters
7. Any elements in outline that don't appear in actual chapters

## Next Steps
1. Read the current chapter-outline.md to understand the documented structure
2. Read each manuscript chapter (1-11) to understand actual content
3. Compare outline descriptions with actual chapter content
4. Identify discrepancies and missing information
5. Update chapter-outline.md to accurately reflect the written story
6. Update projectRoadmap.md with task completion

## Files to Review
- chapter-outline.md (master outline)
- manuscript/chapter-01.md through manuscript/chapter-11.md (actual content)
- cline_docs/continuity.md (for cross-reference)
- cline_docs/characters.md (for character development tracking)
