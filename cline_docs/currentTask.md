## Current Objective
✅ COMPLETED: Implemented literary improvements to Chapter 7 "覚醒" (Awakening) based on specific user feedback to enhance commercial publication quality while maintaining 5-star translation accuracy and avoiding plot changes.

## Context
User provided detailed improvement suggestions in Japanese focusing on four key areas that need refinement without altering the story structure or plot elements.

## Specific Improvement Areas

### 1. 冗長表現の整理 (Eliminate Verbose Expressions)
**Target**: Reduce redundant word usage while maintaining poetic resonance
**Example**: 
- Current: 「彼は自分の内に芽生えつつある何かを感じていた——まだ名前も意味もつけられない何かを。」
- Improved: 「彼は自分の内に芽生えつつある何かを感じていた——まだ名前も意味もつけられないそれを。」

### 2. 場面転換の間合い調整 (Adjust Scene Transition Pacing)
**Target**: Add contemplative pauses between mystical experience and return to reality
**Technique**: Insert brief static descriptions like "その場にしばし佇んだ" without adding new actions or characters

### 3. 感情比喩の調整 (Refine Emotional Metaphors)
**Target**: Replace overly intense metaphors with gentler, more nuanced expressions
**Example**:
- Current: 「胸の内が、星の火が灯ったように燃え上がった。」
- Improved: Use softer expressions like "温もりが広がった" (warmth spread) or "灯された" (was lit)

### 4. 残響描写の重複回避 (Reduce Repetitive Poetic Descriptions)
**Target**: Diversify similar mystical sensory descriptions to avoid redundancy
**Technique**: Vary sensory approaches (light, warmth, resonance) rather than repeating similar "taste" and "resonance" patterns

## Implementation Strategy
1. Systematic scan for target patterns throughout Chapter 7
2. Apply improvements by category while preserving narrative flow and mystical atmosphere
3. Ensure consistency with established translation standards
4. Update translation notes with enhancement techniques
5. Maintain all plot elements, character development, and spiritual themes

## Success Criteria
- Enhanced literary quality for commercial publication standards
- Maintained 5-star translation accuracy
- Improved poetic resonance and fantasy atmosphere
- Reduced redundancy and enhanced readability
- Strengthened scene transitions and pacing
- Preserved all plot elements and character dynamics

## Chapter Context
Chapter 7 depicts Gond's mystical experience in the ancient temple ruins, his divine revelation, and conversation with Sim. Contains significant spiritual/supernatural elements requiring careful handling during improvement.
