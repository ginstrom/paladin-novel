## Current Objective
Reorganize and rewrite chapters 5 and 6 to create a cliffhanger ending for Chapter 5 and dramatic opening for Chapter 6.

## Context
User requested specific reorganization:
- Chapter 5 should end on a cliffhanger with Gond scaling the inner wall
- Sequence: guard passes, tense wait ("a bead of sweat dripped down Gond's nose, falling on the stones 20 feet below"), Gond resumes climb, bells toll, guard's torch reverses course and approaches
- Chapter 6 should start with Gond surging over the wall, hearing shout from below, scrambling down, jumping 15 feet, rolling ankle, running to stream, creating false trail, hiding at grating, then escaping into hills
- Then Chapter 6 continues as before

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Revise Chapter 5 Ending ✓
- Cut Chapter 5 at the wall-climbing cliffhanger moment
- Remove everything after Gond starts climbing the wall
- End with guard's torch reversing course as bells toll

### Phase 2: Revise Chapter 6 Opening ✓
- Add new escape sequence at the beginning
- Seamlessly connect to existing Chapter 6 content
- Maintain narrative flow and tension

### Phase 3: Verification ✓
- Ensure "show, don't tell" principles maintained
- Check character consistency and sardonic tone
- Verify smooth narrative transition between chapters

## Task Status: COMPLETED

### Summary of Changes Made:

**Chapter 5 ("A Change of Course")**:
- Ended on dramatic cliffhanger with Gond three-quarters up the wall
- Added specific tension moment: "A bead of sweat dripped down his nose, falling on the stones twenty feet below"
- Bells begin tolling as alarm is raised
- Guard's torch starts approaching - chapter ends with maximum suspense

**Chapter 6 ("Whispers in Stone")**:
- Added dramatic opening with Gond surging over the wall
- Included escape sequence: jumping 15 feet, rolling ankle, running to stream
- Added clever false trail tactic: doubling back through water to hide at grating
- Pursuers follow false trail upstream while Gond escapes into hills
- Seamlessly connected to existing Chapter 6 content

### Quality Verification:
- Maintained "show, don't tell" principles throughout
- Preserved Gond's character consistency and sardonic tone
- Created smooth narrative flow between chapters
- Enhanced tension and pacing with cliffhanger structure
- All action sequences use concrete sensory details and physical manifestations
