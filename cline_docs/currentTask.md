## Current Objective
Reduce the size of the cover image in the README to 25%

## Context
User requested to reduce the cover image size in README.md to 25% of its current size. The README.md file contains a cover image that was previously added above the "Using the Makefile" section.

## Completed Actions

2. ✅ Read existing README.md file to locate the cover image
3. ✅ Modified cover image from `![Cover](images/cover.png)` to `<img src="images/cover.png" alt="Cover" width="25%">` to reduce size to 25%
4. ✅ Updated currentTask.md to reflect completion

## Files Updated
- ✅ README.md (modified cover image to 25% width)
- ✅ cline_docs/currentTask.md (this file)

## Quality Standards Met
- Proper HTML img tag syntax used with width attribute
- Image size reduced to exactly 25% as requested
- Maintains existing README structure and formatting
- Preserves alt text for accessibility
