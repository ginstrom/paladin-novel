## Current Objective
Revise Chapter 15 ("Burden of Grace") to change the timing and context of Thorek's arrival.

## Context
The user has requested a change to Chapter 15. Currently, Thorek's appearance at the end of Silivana's speech is considered too convenient. The revision will have Thorek arrive two days later, while Gond is at the graves of those who fell defending the valley. This change aims to make Thorek's arrival more impactful and less coincidental.

This task aligns with the overall project goal of writing the "Paladin's Rise" novel and ensuring narrative coherence and quality.

## Implementation Plan
1.  **Review Memory Bank:** Read essential Memory Bank documents (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md` (this file), `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`). (Completed)
2.  **Update `cline_docs/currentTask.md`:** Document the current task and detailed plan. (Completed)
3.  **Read Relevant Files:**
