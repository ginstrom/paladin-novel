## Current Objective
Prepare "Paladin's Rise" for epub conversion by creating part files and filelist for pandoc processing.

## Context
The book has been successfully reorganized into the recommended ebook publishing format with 27 chapters in the chapters/ directory. Now the user has requested preparation for epub conversion using pandoc, which requires:
- Creating part title files for each of the 5 parts
- Creating a filelist.txt file that specifies the order for pandoc processing

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created part1.md through part5.md in chapters/ directory with proper formatting:
   - Part I: The Rude Awakening (Chapters 1-3)
   - Part II: Seeds of Rebellion (Chapters 4-10)
   - Part III: An Unlikely Saint (Chapters 11-16)
   - Part IV: Forging a Free Nation (Chapters 17-21)
   - Part V: The War for Freedom (Chapters 22-27)

2. ✅ Created filelist.txt at top level with all files in correct order for pandoc:
   - Each part file appears before its respective chapters
   - All 32 files listed (5 part files + 27 chapter files)
   - Proper chapters/ prefix for all file paths

## Current Status
The book is now ready for epub conversion using pandoc. The filelist.txt can be passed directly to pandoc to generate the epub with proper part divisions and chapter sequencing.

## Next Steps
Ready for pandoc epub generation using the created filelist.txt file.
