## Current Objective
Apply detailed feedback to improve Chapter 16's Japanese translation (manuscript-ja/16_network-revealed.md), focusing on loanword replacement, dialogue refinement, and overall naturalness enhancement.

## Context
Chapter 16 "Network Revealed" (情報網の正体) has been translated but requires refinement based on comprehensive feedback. The main issues identified are:
- Loanwords disrupting medieval fantasy atmosphere (ネットワーク, コンポーネント, エンジン, チーム)
- Overly literal or stiff renderings reducing emotional impact
- Repetitive or unclear constructions needing polish
- Character voice consistency requiring improvement

## Implementation Plan
1. **Loanword Replacement**: Replace modern loanwords with traditional Japanese alternatives
   - ネットワーク → 組織/繋がり (context-dependent)
   - コンポーネント → 部品/構成要素
   - エンジン → 兵器 (or functional description)
   - チーム → 一団/隊/仲間たち

2. **Dialogue Refinement**: Enhance character speech for fantasy setting appropriateness
   - Improve formal introductions and military speech patterns
   - Deepen emotional expressions for better tone

3. **Remove Translationese**: Eliminate awkward literal translations
   - Smooth overly casual expressions for serious contexts
   - Improve flow of complex sentences

4. **Fix Repetitive Constructions**: Reduce redundant phrasing
   - Vary repeated words (その repeated 3 times → strategic variation)
   - Simplify verbose explanations

5. **Clarify Emotional Transitions**: Make character reactions more specific and impactful

6. **Apply Miscellaneous Improvements**: Address specific phrases and metaphors

## Target Improvements
- Enhanced medieval fantasy atmosphere through traditional vocabulary
- More natural dialogue that fits character roles and setting
- Improved emotional impact and clarity
- Reduced repetition and awkward constructions
- Better flow and readability overall

## Files to Update
- manuscript-ja/16_network-revealed.md (primary target)
