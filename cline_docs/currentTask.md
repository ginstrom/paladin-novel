## Current Objective
Comprehensive spell check of all 27 chapters in the manuscript.

## Context
Requested a full spell check of the novel, with all fantasy names and canonical terms whitelisted. The goal was to identify genuine typos and spelling errors, not to flag invented words or names.

Memory Bank files read:
- `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`
- `cline_docs/currentTask.md` (previous state)
- `cline_docs/techStack.md`
- `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`
- `cline_docs/characters.md`
- `glossary-en-ja.md`

## Plan & Execution
1. Built a whitelist of canonical names and terms from `characters.md` and `glossary-en-ja.md`.
2. Read all 27 chapter files in the `chapters/` directory.
3. Identified and recorded all likely spelling errors and typos, ignoring whitelisted terms.
4. Compiled a detailed report, organized by chapter, with suggested corrections and context.
5. Saved the report as `cline_docs/spellcheck_report.md`.

## Result
- Spell check completed for all chapters.
- All detected errors and likely typos are documented in `cline_docs/spellcheck_report.md`.
- No fantasy names or canonical terms were flagged.
- Ambiguous cases (e.g., "Horsing trading") are noted for review.

## Next Steps
1. Review and implement corrections as needed, using the report as a checklist.
2. Update documentation after corrections.

## Task Plan (2025-05-31)

### Objective
Apply all spelling corrections listed in `cline_docs/spellcheck_report.md` to the corresponding chapters in the manuscript.

### Steps
1. Systematically process each chapter listed in the spellcheck report.
2. For each chapter, make the minimum required changes to correct only the specified typos, preserving all other content.
3. For ambiguous cases (e.g., "Horsing trading"), review context and apply the suggested correction unless authorial intent clearly dictates otherwise.
4. After all corrections, update documentation as needed (e.g., codebaseSummary.md, projectRoadmap.md if warranted).
5. Run a build/test (e.g., combine chapters, check for errors) to verify manuscript integrity.

### Chapters to Edit (per report)

### Documentation to Update
- Update this file with progress and completion notes.
- Update codebaseSummary.md with a summary of the spelling correction pass.

### Testing
- After corrections, run the combine_chapters.py script to ensure all chapters build cleanly into the master document.
- Spot-check a few chapters for formatting and error-free output.

### Notes
- Make only the minimum required changes; do not alter narrative, style, or formatting except as needed for the corrections.
- If any correction appears to conflict with established names or terms, consult the canonical lists or ask for clarification.
