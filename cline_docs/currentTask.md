## Current Objective
Translate Chapter 18 "First Stand" (chapters/18_first-stand.md) from English to Japanese

## Context
This is the next chapter in the ongoing Japanese translation series of "Paladin's Rise" (聖騎士の目覚め). Chapter 18 depicts a major battle with 200 professional soldiers attacking the settlement, featuring strategic military planning, siege warfare, divine power manifestations, and significant character development for Gond as a paladin leader.

## Planned Actions
1. **Create Japanese translation file**: `manuscript-ja/18_first-stand.md`
2. **Apply established translation methodology**: 6-phase process from translation guide
3. **Maintain character speech consistency**: Using established patterns from previous 17 chapters
4. **Handle complex military terminology**: Professional soldiers, siege engines, tactical formations
5. **Preserve divine power descriptions**: Consistent with previous chapters' manifestations
6. **Introduce new character**: Battlemaster Korgan Ironshield with appropriate dwarf speech patterns
7. **Create comprehensive documentation**: Translation notes file with decisions and cultural adaptations
8. **Update glossary**: Add new terms and verify existing terminology usage
9. **Quality verification**: Target 5-star naturalness and accuracy ratings

## Key Translation Challenges
- Complex battle sequences requiring natural Japanese military terminology
- Divine power manifestations needing consistency with established descriptions
- Political dialogue between religious factions requiring appropriate formality levels
- New character integration while maintaining established speech patterns
- Balancing visceral combat descriptions with "show don't tell" principles

## Quality Standards
- 5-star naturalness and accuracy ratings (matching previous chapters)
- 20-30% compression from literal translation
- Traditional language preference (avoid modern loanwords)
- Consistent ellipsis usage (…) instead of three dots
- Proper Japanese literary flow and rhythm
- Character speech pattern consistency verification

## Next Steps
1. Create the Japanese translation applying all established methodology
2. Document translation decisions and cultural adaptations
3. Update glossary with new military and character terms
4. Verify quality against established standards
