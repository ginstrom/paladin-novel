## Recent Significant Changes
- [2025-05-31] TIMING CREDIBILITY AUDIT: Conducted a review of messenger arrival and attack timings across all chapters. Minor clarifications were added to Chapter 14 ("The Legend Begins") and Chapter 18 ("First Stand") to enhance the realism of short warning periods before attacks. The audit and changes were documented in `cline_docs/timeContinuity.md`.
- [2025-05-31] DIALOGUE COLLOQUIALISM & TONE REFINEMENT: Completed a significant pass across multiple chapters (Ch 2, 4, 10, 11, 15, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27) to make dialogue more colloquial and natural, particularly in high-stress scenes. This included refining Gond's dialogue to reflect a kinder, less gruff tone as his divine power and leadership matured, while maintaining his established colloquial speech. Care was taken to preserve a more solemn tone for divine pronouncements and moments of high significance.
- [2025-05-31] MAERA'S MAGICAL LEAF ENHANCEMENTS: Added further details and effects of Maera's magical leaf. In Chapter 6 (`chapters/06_whispers-in-stone.md`), Gond and Pell notice their tracks are fainter than expected, subtly hinting at the leaf's evasive properties. In Chapter 8 (`chapters/08_valley-of-hope.md`), Sim observes the leaf glowing and guiding them towards the valley during their journey. Chapter 3's (`chapters/03_shore-of-second-chances.md`) initial introduction was confirmed consistent.
- [2025-05-31] MAERA'S MAGICAL LEAF BACKSTORY: Integrated backstory explaining how refugees find the hidden valley. Added scene in Chapter 3 where Maera gives Sim a magically attuned leaf (minor elven magic) that glows when pointed toward the valley and may aid in evading pursuit. Updated Chapter 8 so Lira presents the leaf upon arrival as proof of Maera's guidance. Updated Maera's character entry to reflect this new magical ability and role in guiding refugees.
- [2025-05-31] MAGIC CONSISTENCY AUDIT: Conducted a comprehensive review of magical effects for Alanyi (gold/fire), Turin (silver/lightning), and Gorlatch (black/poison) across all relevant chapters. Created `cline_docs/magic_consistency_audit.md` to log all instances and track changes. Edits were made to chapters 17, 22, 23, 24, and 26 to enhance or correct descriptions, ensuring alignment with the established divine magic signatures. All identified pending items in the audit log were addressed.
- [2025-05-30] EPUB TOC FIX: Modified `Makefile` to adjust Pandoc TOC generation options (`--toc-depth=1 --number-sections=false`). This prevents sequential numbering of the book title and chapters in the EPUB table of contents, ensuring chapters retain their "Chapter X: Title" format without extraneous leading numbers.
- [2025-05-30] MAJOR CHAPTER 19 REWRITE ("The Tide Turns"): Complete rewrite to align with narrative continuity from Chapters 15-18 and requirements for Chapter 20. The new chapter depicts Gond's strategic ambush and annihilation of the main Slavers' Alliance army (2000+ strong) at Millhaven Pass. Features detailed tactical planning, coordinated multi-racial forces (humans, dwarves, elves), mobile siege engine deployment, and a climactic battle sequence. This decisive victory fundamentally shifts the war from defensive to offensive strategy, directly enabling the planned attacks on slaver cities that open Chapter 20. Adheres to "show, don't tell" principles with visceral combat descriptions and character development.
- [2025-05-30] CHAPTER 15 & 16 REVISIONS: Added a new section to the end of Chapter 15 ("Burden of Grace") detailing the initial weeks of offensive operations. This includes scenes of successful caravan raids, the arrival and training of liberated slaves, the acquisition of supplies, and the symbolic widening of the valley path with Gond's declaration "The time for hiding is over." The opening of Chapter 16 ("The Network Revealed") was then modified to reflect these changes, with Maera's group arriving at a more developed, active, and defended settlement, making the subsequent alliance offer more plausible. User edits were incorporated to refine the new content in both chapters.
- [2025-05-30] CHAPTER 16 REVISION ("The Network Revealed"): Corrected a continuity error regarding Grimjaw Ironforge's arrival at the valley settlement. Previously, he arrived with a fully assembled siege engine, contradicting Chapter 6 which states carts cannot reach the valley. The revision changes this so Grimjaw brings components (strange contraptions, glowing steel bands, timber) hauled by oxen. These components are then used to assemble war machines at the valley entrance, maintaining his engineering prowess and military contribution while respecting established geographical constraints.
- [2025-05-30] CHAPTER 15 REVISION ("Burden of Grace"): Altered the timing and context of Thorek Ironheart's arrival. He now appears two days after the battle, finding Gond at the graves of the fallen, rather than immediately after Silivana's counsel. This change aims for a more impactful and less convenient introduction, deepening the emotional weight of the scene and Thorek's subsequent alliance offer. User edits were incorporated to refine dialogue and actions.

## User Feedback Integration
- [2025-05-27] User requested project reorganization to match ebook publishing format: Create chapters/ directory with descriptive filenames, rename assets/ to images/, create build/ directory, move synopsis to cline_docs/, create metadata.yml with integrated blurb, add epub.css stylesheet. Successfully implemented complete restructuring following recommended format.
- [2025-05-27] User provided comprehensive translation improvement instructions for Chapter 1 Japanese translation: systematic term replacement (English quotes → Japanese brackets, manacle terminology correction), natural Japanese language optimization with 20-30% compression, cultural localization of metaphors, style unification with consistent 常体 narrative voice, and quality control through audio reading tests and particle correction.
- [2025-05-26] User requested Chapter 3 expansion to flesh out Maera's role and provide world-building: Give more details of Maera's hut, show her awareness of their plight and hint at other escapees, have her provide world-building information about slavery being accepted as fact of life, slaves being sent far away or worked to death, existence of those who oppose slavery, detailed information about hiding places (way station and hills with benefits/problems), warnings about Blackwater dangers while only advising never compelling, and subtle foreshadowing of her future role as major figure in slave revolt running a network that helps slaves escape and maintaining contact with elves.
- [2025-05-26] User requested Chapter 6 enhancement to add more buildup and make divine signs start more subtly: Have them set up camp in temple grounds with immediate positive effects (greener grass, horse calming and whickering, cooler/fresher air, group relief). Gond sets out to scout but finds himself wandering unconsciously, guided to an intact chamber deep in the temple. Enhanced divine encounter at altar with vision and voice: "You carry burdens willingly, Gond. Now carry hope." Sim notices change in Gond's expression but doesn't press directly. Divine signs should be subtle enough that Gond questions them until the voice speaks.
- [2025-05-26] User requested Chapter 5 enhancement to add suspense and danger: Gond must postpone revenge plans, leave behind his horse, wait for nightfall and escape by scaling city walls, walk back to waypoint, explain that slavers are looking for them, and head off seeking hiding place on remaining horse.
- [2025-05-26] User requested Chapter 1 enhancement to show hopelessness of Gond's situation and cruelty of guards, emphasizing salt mine destination where slaves are worked to death with most surviving only a few months.
- [2025-05-26] User requested Chapter 22 rewrite for continuity with Chapter 21's spiritual themes, focusing on Gond's spiritual growth, the three-pronged campaign's sacred goals (coastal cities/Gond, inland strongholds/dwarves, logistics/elves), the attack on three successive cities by Gond, off-camera preparations for dwarven/elven attacks with reports, Silviana's pacifism versus general elven willingness to fight, and preparations for temple purification.
- [2025-05-26] User requested major Chapter 21 rewrite: establish Turin as dominant worship with Alanyi's temples in ruins, reflect Gond's growing charismatic leadership with Alanyi speaking through him, shift goals from modern liberty/egalitarianism to restoration of Alanyi's influence and mercy tempering Turin's justice, choose Sim as leader of Alanyi's revival, have Silviana help human order restore lost knowledge and rites.
- [2025-05-23] User provided comprehensive "show, don't tell" feedback with specific patterns to eliminate, word alerts, character guidelines, and rewriting process. This has been fully integrated into the project's authoring methodology through updated guidelines and new reference documentation.
- [2025-05-23] User requested major chapter reorganization to fit new outline structure: move temple experience from Chapter 10 to Chapter 6, restructure Chapters 6-10 to show gradual paladin awakening, create placeholder chapters 11-25 with detailed TODO notes for missing content.
- [2025-05-23] User requested major story arc restructuring: move temple experience earlier, create gradual paladin awakening progression, expand Maera's role as rebellion network builder, and implement specific divine power manifestation sequence culminating in clear healing miracle after major battle.
- [2025-05-22] User requested continuity fixes in `manuscript/chapter-01.md` regarding slave descriptions and Gond's reactions.
