## Pre-Writing Checklist
Before beginning to write or significantly alter a chapter, complete the following steps:

1.  **Review Project Roadmap (`cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`):**
    *   Understand how the current chapter fits into the overall project goals and the novel's arc.

2.  **Review Current Task (`cline_docs/currentTask.md`):**
    *   Confirm the specific objectives for the current writing session, including any particular focus points or elements to include.

3.  **Consult Chapter Outline (`outlines/chapter-outline.md`):**
    *   Re-familiarize yourself with the summary and key events planned for the chapter within the context of the entire book.

4.  **Consult Relevant Part Outline (e.g., `outlines/outline-part-1.md`):**
    *   Dive deeper into the detailed outline for the specific part of the book the chapter belongs to. This provides more granular plot points and thematic notes.

5.  **Refer to Synopsis (`manuscript/synopsis.md`):**
    *   Reinforce your understanding of the overarching story, key themes, and the intended narrative tone.

6.  **Refer to Book Notes (`manuscript/book-notes.md`):**
    *   Check for any specific authorial notes, character insights, or world-building details relevant to the chapter.

7.  **CRUCIAL: Thoroughly Review Continuity Document (`cline_docs/continuity.md`):**
    *   This is the most critical step for maintaining narrative integrity.
    *   Verify the current status, location, and physical/mental state of all characters appearing in the chapter.
    *   Check for any unresolved plot threads that might be addressed or impacted.
    *   Ensure consistency with previously established world-building rules, timelines, and significant items.

8.  **Review Character Bible (`cline_docs/characters.md`):**
    *   Refresh your memory on the bios, personality traits, and established history of characters involved in the chapter.

## Writing Process

1.  **Narrative Voice and Style:**
    *   Maintain a third-person, past tense narrative.
    *   **Show, don't tell:** This is paramount. Use actions, dialogue, sensory details, and internal thoughts to convey information and emotion, rather than explicit exposition. Avoid stating character emotions or intentions directly; let them be inferred.
    *   **Pacing:** Linger over world-setting and character development to build immersion. Move briskly through action scenes to maintain tension and excitement.
    *   **Dialogue:** When description alone is insufficient to convey necessary information or character nuances, employ dialogue. Ensure dialogue is natural, serves a purpose (reveals character, advances plot, provides exposition subtly), and is appropriate to the character's voice, background, and current emotional state.
    *   **Avoid "Telling" Statements:** Steer clear of summary statements that tell the reader what happened or what characters decided (e.g., "The slaves decided to escape"). Instead, show the decision-making process or the actions leading to the event.
    *   Embody Gond's characteristic sardonic wit and internal monologue style, even when the narration is not directly from his perspective.
    *   Adhere to the stylistic guidelines set in `.clinerules` and `.cursorrules` for fiction writing (e.g., vivid descriptions, character depth).

2.  **Information Integration:**
    *   Seamlessly weave in details and plot points from all consulted source documents.
    *   Ensure that character actions and dialogue are consistent with their established personalities and motivations.

3.  **Focus Areas:**
    *   Balance action, dialogue, internal thoughts (especially Gond's), and descriptive passages.
    *   Show, don't just tell. Use character actions and environmental details to convey information and emotion.

## Post-Writing Checklist
Immediately after completing a chapter draft or significant revisions:

1.  **Update Continuity Document (`cline_docs/continuity.md`):**
    *   This is the **first and most crucial** post-writing step.
    *   Record any new plot points or events that occurred in the chapter.
    *   Update the status, location, and condition of all affected characters.
    *   Note any new character introductions (even minor ones).
    *   Resolve any previously open plot threads that were addressed, or add new ones that emerged.
    *   Document any new items of significance or world-building details introduced.
    *   Add a timestamp to the "Last Updated" section of `cline_docs/continuity.md`.

2.  **Update Current Task (`cline_docs/currentTask.md`):**
    *   Mark the chapter writing sub-task as complete.
    *   Outline any immediate next steps or reflections from the writing process.

3.  **Update Project Roadmap (`cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`):**
    *   Log the completion of the chapter under the main goal of "Write 'The Reluctant Paladin' novel."
    *   Note any significant progress or milestones achieved.

4.  **Update Codebase Summary (`cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`):**
    *   If a new chapter file was created, add it to the list of manuscript files.
    *   If any other new documentation or structural files were created as part of the task, list them.
