## Pre-Writing Checklist
Before beginning to write or significantly alter a chapter, complete the following steps:

1.  **Review Project Roadmap (`cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md`):**
    *   Understand how the current chapter fits into the overall project goals and the novel's arc.

2.  **Review Current Task (`cline_docs/currentTask.md`):**
    *   Confirm the specific objectives for the current writing session, including any particular focus points or elements to include.

3.  **Consult Chapter Outline (`outlines/chapter-outline.md`):**
    *   Re-familiarize yourself with the summary and key events planned for the chapter within the context of the entire book.

4.  **Consult Relevant Part Outline (e.g., `outlines/outline-part-1.md`):**
    *   Dive deeper into the detailed outline for the specific part of the book the chapter belongs to. This provides more granular plot points and thematic notes.

5.  **Refer to Synopsis (`manuscript/synopsis.md`):**
    *   Reinforce your understanding of the overarching story, key themes, and the intended narrative tone.

6.  **Refer to Book Notes (`manuscript/book-notes.md`):**
    *   Check for any specific authorial notes, character insights, or world-building details relevant to the chapter.

7.  **CRUCIAL: Thoroughly Review Continuity Document (`cline_docs/continuity.md`):**
    *   This is the most critical step for maintaining narrative integrity.
    *   Verify the current status, location, and physical/mental state of all characters appearing in the chapter.
    *   Check for any unresolved plot threads that might be addressed or impacted.
    *   Ensure consistency with previously established world-building rules, timelines, and significant items.

8.  **Review Character Bible (`cline_docs/characters.md`):**
    *   Refresh your memory on the bios, personality traits, and established history of characters involved in the chapter.

## Writing Process

1.  **Narrative Voice and Style:**
    *   Maintain a third-person, past tense narrative.
    *   **Show, don't tell:** This is paramount. Use actions, dialogue, sensory details, and internal thoughts to convey information and emotion, rather than explicit exposition. Avoid stating character emotions or intentions directly; let them be inferred.
    *   **Pacing:** Linger over world-setting and character development to build immersion. Move briskly through action scenes to maintain tension and excitement.
    *   **Dialogue:** When description alone is insufficient to convey necessary information or character nuances, employ dialogue. Ensure dialogue is natural, serves a purpose (reveals character, advances plot, provides exposition subtly), and is appropriate to the character's voice, background, and current emotional state.
    *   **Avoid "Telling" Statements:** Steer clear of summary statements that tell the reader what happened or what characters decided (e.g., "The slaves decided to escape"). Instead, show the decision-making process or the actions leading to the event.
    *   Embody Gond's characteristic sardonic wit and internal monologue style, even when the narration is not directly from his perspective.
    *   Adhere to the stylistic guidelines set in `.clinerules` and `.cursorrules` for fiction writing (e.g., vivid descriptions, character depth).

2.  **Information Integration:**
    *   Seamlessly weave in details and plot points from all consulted source documents.
    *   Ensure that character actions and dialogue are consistent with their established personalities and motivations.

3.  **Focus Areas:**
    *   Balance action, dialogue, internal thoughts (especially Gond's), and descriptive passages.
    *   Show, don't just tell. Use character actions and environmental details to convey information and emotion.

## Comprehensive "Show, Don't Tell" Guidelines

### Core Principle
**Instead of stating emotions, thoughts, or character traits directly, reveal them through:**
- Physical actions and reactions
- Dialogue and speech patterns
- Sensory details (what characters see, hear, feel, smell, taste)
- Body language and facial expressions
- Environmental interactions

### Specific "Tell" Patterns to Eliminate

#### 1. **Direct Emotional Statements**
❌ **Don't:** "Rage surged in Gond's chest" / "Hope flickered in her eyes" / "Fear gripped him"
✅ **Do:** Show through physical manifestations
- Clenched fists, tight jaw, shallow breathing
- Eyes brightening, shoulders straightening, tentative smile
- Stumbling, sweating palms, rapid heartbeat

#### 2. **Character Assessment Summaries**
❌ **Don't:** "He was a skilled fighter" / "She felt grateful" / "Trust was building between them"
✅ **Do:** Show through behavior
- Demonstrate skill through fluid combat movements
- Show gratitude through actions (kneeling, reaching out, voice catching)
- Show trust through shared glances, following without question, turning backs to each other

#### 3. **Mental State Declarations**
❌ **Don't:** "Gond felt determined" / "Confusion reigned" / "He sensed danger"
✅ **Do:** Show through actions and reactions
- Squaring shoulders, lengthening stride, checking weapons
- People talking over each other, pointing in different directions, hesitating
- Hand moving to sword hilt, scanning surroundings, muscles tensing

#### 4. **Relationship/Social Dynamic Summaries**
❌ **Don't:** "Their strange alliance" / "The refugees looked to him for leadership" / "Respect was growing"
✅ **Do:** Show through interactions
- Let different approaches to problems reveal character roles naturally
- Show people waiting for his words, stepping aside as he passes, bringing him problems
- Show through changed behavior—less arguing, more following suggestions, seeking his opinion

#### 5. **Decision-Making Process Statements**
❌ **Don't:** "He decided to help" / "They agreed to the plan" / "She committed to the journey"
✅ **Do:** Show the process and outcome
- Show him shouldering pack, extending hand, drawing weapon
- Show nods, gathering supplies, forming up in traveling order
- Show her checking gear, taking determined steps forward

### Word/Phrase Alerts to Watch For
- **Emotion words:** rage, hope, fear, joy, despair, anger, relief, etc.
- **"Felt" statements:** "felt determined," "felt grateful," "felt confused"
- **"Sensed" statements:** "sensed danger," "sensed his mood," "sensed opportunity"
- **Mental state verbs:** realized, understood, decided, knew, thought
- **Summary phrases:** "their bond," "growing respect," "emerging leadership"

### Character-Specific Guidelines

#### **Gond (Main Character):**
- Maintain his sardonic internal voice through action and observation
- Show his mercenary skills through fluid, professional movements
- Reveal his growing responsibility through protective actions, not statements
- His reluctance should show through hesitation before decisive action

#### **Supporting Characters:**
- **Pell:** Show his roguish nature through quick movements, observant glances, appearing with useful items
- **Sim:** Show his faith through calm actions in chaos, gentle touches, prayers that affect others
- **Refugees:** Show their fear/hope through clustering behavior, watching Gond, hesitant questions

### Rewriting Process

#### **Step 1: Identify "Tell" Passages**
Scan for the alert words/phrases above and highlight them.

#### **Step 2: Convert Each "Tell" to "Show"**
For each instance:
1. Ask: "What would someone see/hear if they witnessed this emotion/thought/decision?"
2. Replace with concrete, observable details
3. Use sensory information when possible

#### **Step 3: Maintain Pacing and Voice**
- Keep action scenes moving quickly with short, punchy descriptions
- Allow descriptive scenes to linger on sensory details
- Preserve Gond's characteristic wit and observations
- Ensure dialogue serves multiple purposes (character, plot, mood)

#### **Step 4: Quality Check**
- Can a reader infer the emotions/thoughts from the actions shown?
- Are character relationships clear from their interactions?
- Does the scene feel immersive rather than reported?

### Example Transformation

**Before (Tell):**
"Gond felt a surge of responsibility and determination as he looked at the frightened refugees who desperately needed his leadership."

**After (Show):**
"Gond's gaze swept across the upturned faces—some tear-streaked, others hollow with exhaustion, all waiting. He straightened his shoulders, checked his sword, and stepped forward. 'Here's what we're going to do.'"

### Maintain These Strengths
- Vivid environmental descriptions
- Strong dialogue with distinct character voices  
- Well-paced action sequences
- Gond's sardonic observations and internal commentary
- Rich sensory details of settings
