**LLM REVISION DIRECTIVES for *The Reluctant Paladin***
(Use exactly the headings, sub-headings, and checklist bullets below when prompting the writing-LLM.)

---

## 1. Flesh-Out / Add Detail

1. **Chapter 2 “Breaking Chains” – Planning Phase**

   * Show the *full* whisper-level strategy session between Gond, Jord, Pell, and Sim **before** the uprising. Emphasise personalities: Gond’s calculated calm, Jord’s impatience, Pell’s tactical eye, Sim’s quiet faith. Use a tense, beat-by-beat dialogue (≈250 words) to replace the brief nods now present.
2. **Shore Aftermath (Chapter 3)**

   * Insert a 150-word sensory paragraph of hypothermia, nausea, and survivor’s guilt during manacle filing; let Pell’s humour mask fear; let Sim bind Gond’s raw wrists. This deepens the trio bond before Maera’s hut.
3. **Healing-Cost Arc**

   * Thread three *short* flash sensations (5–10 lines each) in later chapters that echo Mira’s healing scene—the pulse, the hollowing cost—so the reader feels cumulative fatigue, not a single revelation.
4. **Council Politics (Part IV, Chapters 18-19)**

   * Replace summary sentences with live debate snippets: Thorek’s fist-pounding, Sim’s parables, Elena’s sarcasm. Target 300 words of dialogue plus body-language beats to dramatise the ideological clash (justice vs mercy).
5. **Final Conflict Stakes**

   * Add a ticking clock: slaver coalition plans to “re-tag” 500 refugees at Dawn Market. Show intel arriving, Gond’s internal conflict, and one preparatory scene with Pell scouting the market (≈350 words) to raise climax tension before liberation assault (currently skipped).

## 2. Compress / Tighten

1. **Escape Sequence Duplication**

   * The ship-deck fight and beach crawl appear twice (turn 3 file 2 & file 12/14). Keep the later, more polished version; delete the earlier duplicate or merge only unique lines for continuity.
2. **Travel-Montage Prose**

   * Where chapters open with multiple landscape paragraphs (e.g., Chapter 7 “Gradual Awakening” first 180 words) condense to one vivid image plus one sensory detail; remove redundant “morning light” descriptions.
3. **Epilogue Info-Dump**

   * Break the long “ten-years-later” paragraph list into three *story nuggets* told through living scenes (e.g., Kael teaching children, Elena dictating her memoir) and drop minor résumé lines. Total word-count ≤400 (now ≈650).

## 3. Continuity / Missing Information

1. **Chapter Numbering** – Chapter 3 is declared twice (Part I) and Chapters jump from 7→18. Renumber sequentially.
2. **Brand Visibility** – Gond’s forehead brand is noted in Darach (Part II) but ignored in council scenes. Include either a magical fading explanation or have characters react in later chapters.
3. **Pell Character Arc** – Establish a callback to his earlier “coins over conscience” attitude with a moment where he refuses blood-money, showing growth.
4. **Sim’s Pacifism Boundary** – Clarify whether Sim ever uses violence; current text hints but never resolves (add one decisive scene or explicit inner vow).
5. **Timeline Clarity** – Insert dateline tags or anchor phrases after major time jumps (escape → valley settlement months later; liberation → continental congress three months later) to avoid reader confusion.

---

## 4. Reading-Level & Style Adjustments

* Aim for Flesch–Kincaid grade 8-9:

  * Replace archaisms (“whilst,” “commence”) with modern but era-neutral diction.
  * Shorten multi-clause sentences to max 25 words; prefer active voice.
  * Keep Gond’s sardonic interior monologue, but trim three consecutive metaphors to one strong image.

---

## 5. Pacing Notes

* **Act I** is well-balanced; **Act II** drags during settlement building. Apply a *scene-goal-conflict-disaster* cycle every 1.5–2 k words.
* Intensify midpoint turn: foreshadow settlement attack two scenes earlier with ominous smoke or refugee rumours (now revealed suddenly).
