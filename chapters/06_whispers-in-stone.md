# Chapter 6: Whispers in Stone

Gond surged up the last few feet of wall, muscles screaming as he hauled himself over the parapet. Below, a shout erupted from the guard who'd spotted his silhouette against the stars.

"There! On the wall!"

More voices joined the cry. Torches converged on his position. Gond scrambled down the outer face, finding fewer handholds but driven by desperation. The ground rushed up to meet him.

He dropped the final fifteen feet, hitting hard and rolling to absorb the impact. Pain shot through his ankle like a blade, but he forced himself upright. Behind him, crossbow bolts sparked off the parapet where he'd been moments before.

Gond ran, favoring his injured ankle but moving fast. Ahead, a stream cut through the landscape, its banks lined with thick brush. Gond ran along the stream for twenty yards, then splashed into the calf-deep water, the cold shock driving away the pain for precious seconds.

Instead of following the stream away from the city, he doubled back, wading downstream toward where the water entered Blackwater through an iron grating. The current tugged at his boots as he pressed himself against the stone arch above the grating, hidden in the shadows.

Shouts echoed from the wall. "He went toward the stream!"

"This way! Follow the water!"

Torchlight bobbed along the stream bank as his pursuers took the false trail upstream, away from the city. Gond counted their voices—at least six men, maybe more. They crashed through the brush like hounds on a scent, following his obvious path away from Blackwater.

He waited, pressed against the cold stone, until their voices faded into the distance. Only then did he climb down from the grating and circle around through the darkness, striking out for the hills that promised sanctuary.

The bells of Blackwater faded behind Gond as he limped north through the darkness. Each step sent fire through his twisted ankle, but he forced himself to maintain a steady pace. The alarm would bring mounted patrols within the hour. He needed distance.

The road stretched empty before him, a pale ribbon in the starlight. Without his horse, the journey back to the waypoint would take most of the night. Gond pulled his cloak tighter against the chill and settled into the rhythm of a forced march—the kind that had kept him alive through a dozen campaigns.

Every shadow might conceal an ambush. Every sound could herald pursuit. When an owl hooted in the darkness, his hand found his sword hilt. When wind rustled through roadside grass, he froze until the sound passed. The doubled bounty would draw every sellsword and bounty hunter within fifty miles. Five hundred royals could buy a man a farm, or a woman her freedom.

An hour into his journey, hoofbeats echoed from the south. Gond dove into a roadside ditch, pressing himself against the muddy bank as three riders thundered past. Torchlight flickered across their faces—city guards, riding hard. They didn't slow.

He waited until their hoofbeats faded before climbing back onto the road. His clothes were soaked with ditch water, and mud caked his boots. The cold bit deeper now, seeping through wet fabric to chill his bones.

The road began to climb as it left the coastal plain. Rocky outcroppings provided better cover, and Gond used them, checking his back trail from each vantage point. No pursuit yet, but that would change with dawn. They'd find his escape route eventually, and then the real hunt would begin.

Dawn was breaking when he finally saw the way-station's broken walls through the morning mist. Smoke rose from the chimney—a welcome sight that meant his people were safe. But as he approached, Gond noticed something that made him pause.

Fresh horse tracks circled the building. Too many tracks, from too many different horses. His hand found his sword hilt as he crept closer, using the ruins for cover.

Voices carried on the morning air—Pell's distinctive laugh, Sim's calm tones, and others he didn't recognize. Gond circled to the back of the building, where a gap in the wall offered a view of the courtyard.

Relief flooded through him. The tracks belonged to a merchant's pack train—five horses laden with trade goods, their owner haggling with Pell over the price of dried fish. The merchant was a weathered man with kind eyes, the sort who asked no questions about brands or bounties.

Gond waited until the merchant departed before revealing himself. Pell's grin of relief was worth the cold, wet night of hiding.

"Thought they'd caught you for sure," Pell said, clasping his shoulder. "Those bells rang for hours."

Alia and Dax emerged from the shelter, their faces lighting with relief at Gond's return.

"We thought…" Alia began, then stopped, shaking her head. "You were gone so long."

"Blackwater is death," Gond concluded, settling heavily beside their small fire. His ankle throbbed, and exhaustion weighed on his shoulders like a lead cloak. "They've doubled our bounty. Guards are searching every building, questioning every merchant. And they have the horse."

Pell's eyebrow arched. "What? How?"

"Surrounded him before I could get back." Gond's jaw tightened. The faithful horse had carried him through danger, and he'd repaid that loyalty by leading them both into a trap. "Which means they know we're in the area. They'll expand the search."

"How long before they find us?" Alia asked, unconsciously moving closer to her brother.

"Days, maybe less—word travels fast when there's gold involved." Gond studied their faces in the firelight—frightened, hopeful, trusting. The weight of responsibility settled heavier on his shoulders. "We need to disappear. Deep into the hills where horses can't follow."

"Into thin air?" Pell's voice carried forced lightness, but his eyes were serious.

"Into the wilderness." Gond recalled Maera's map, the careful marks she'd made showing safe routes and hidden refuges. "Too rugged for slavers. Too remote for bounty hunters. We hide, rest, plan our next move."

Sim nodded, that calm certainty settling over him like a mantle. "Wisdom. Safety first." He paused, stroking his beard thoughtfully. "There are older sanctuaries in these hills. Places forgotten by most."

"Forgotten ruins sound perfect for forgotten people," Pell muttered.

Dax flexed his hands, testing the strength that had returned to them. "I worked with my father's carpentry crew before…" He gestured at his brand. "I know how to build, if we can find the materials. But we'll need tools. Axes for felling trees. Saws for cutting lumber."

"One problem at a time," Gond said. "First we survive. Then we build."

He looked around the circle of faces—frightened, hopeful, trusting. Something shifted in his chest. The weight of responsibility settled there, heavy but not unwelcome. These people depended on him. Their safety mattered more than his personal vengeance.

"Dawn, then." His voice carried new authority, the tone of a man who'd made his choice. "We take the remaining horse and disappear."

Pell's grin held anticipation and wariness in equal measure. "Let's hope hidden stays hidden."

***

They broke camp before sunrise, moving with the quiet efficiency of people who understood that noise meant death. Whatever protection had shielded the way-station from casual discovery, it wouldn't hold against a determined search. The mysterious concealment had bought them precious time, but Gond knew better than to trust their lives to blessings and curses.

Gond took the first turn riding their remaining horse, dozing in the saddle and resting his sore ankle. Soon he switched off with Dax, whose injured feet were healing well but still tender.

The path Sim chose led steadily upward, away from the coastal roads and into the wild heart of the hills. Ancient trails wound between towering pines and moss-covered boulders, paths that seemed more memory than reality. Soft drizzle whispered through the landscape, turning everything grey and ghostly.

"How do you know these ways?" Gond asked as they navigated a particularly treacherous slope.

Sim's smile was gentle. "I wasn't always a priest. Before Alanyi called me, I was… other things. A man learns the hidden paths when his life depends on staying hidden."

They traveled in single file, Sim leading, Gond bringing up the rear. Every hour, he called a halt and climbed to higher ground, scanning their back trail for signs of pursuit. The guards would find the waystation eventually, but by then they'd be deep in country where a party with carts couldn't follow.

During one such halt, Pell joined Gond on a rocky outcrop overlooking the path they’d taken. Gond’s eyes narrowed, tracing their passage through the damp earth and fallen leaves. "Odd," he muttered, more to himself than to Pell.

Pell followed his gaze. "What's odd? See something?"

Gond shook his head. "No, that's just it. Our tracks… they're fainter than they should be. Especially with the horse. Almost as if the rain's washing them away faster than it ought to, or…" He trailed off, unable to articulate the subtle wrongness. Sim, who had been resting with Alia and Dax below, carried the small, silver-green leaf Maera had given him tucked securely in his tunic. Gond hadn't given it much thought, but Maera had mentioned it might make them harder to follow.

Pell squinted at the barely discernible trail. A grin touched his lips. "Well, maybe we all just need to fatten up a bit, eh? Leave a proper mark for anyone curious enough to follow." He clapped Gond on the shoulder. "Less work for you, covering our trail."

Gond grunted, unconvinced. He made a mental note to observe Sim more closely.

The first sign of trouble came at midday. Smoke rose from the direction they'd come—campfires. From the direction and distance Gond surmised they were at the waystation.

"They're so close," Alia whispered, staring at the smoke.

The afternoon brought new challenges. The trail grew steeper, winding through narrow defiles where loose stone threatened to betray their passage. Dax struggled to stay mounted as the horse picked its way over treacherous ground. Alia began to stumble.

Gond called another halt, this time to tend wounds and redistribute supplies. They couldn't afford to slow down.

"How much farther?" Alia asked, her face pale with exhaustion.

Sim consulted the sun's position, then pointed toward a distant ridge. "Beyond that rise. An old temple of Alanyi lies in a hidden grove, sheltered by hills. We can rest there for the night."

"Temple?" Pell's voice carried skepticism. "I thought we were looking for a cave or a shepherd's hut."

"This is better." Sim's eyes held quiet certainty. "Nobody visits this temple. They think it's haunted," he smiled wryly.

They pressed on, the ridge seeming to retreat with each step. The drizzle turned to steady rain, soaking through their clothes and making the rocky path treacherous. Gond found himself constantly checking their back trail, expecting to see pursuit cresting each hill behind them.

As evening approached, they finally reached the ridge. The view beyond took Gond's breath away—a hidden grove nestled among steep hills, green and peaceful in the fading light. Ancient stone walls emerged from the mist, partially hidden by climbing ivy and thick moss.

"There," Sim said simply. "Sanctuary."

The moment their horse stepped onto the temple grounds, its ears pricked forward and it released a soft whicker of contentment. Gond stopped, warmth spreading through his chest. The sensation was neither pleasant nor painful, just… puzzling.

The turf beneath their feet was different than the rocky ground they had been traveling over—thicker, greener. The air carried a fresh smell that contrasted with the dusty trail. Dax's limp eased as he walked, and even Pell's perpetual tension seemed to drain a little from his shoulders.

"Your goddess has strange tastes," Gond muttered, though his voice lacked its usual edge.

Sim's gaze lingered on the weathered stones. "This was a sanctuary. Once, such temples stood throughout the land. Now they crumble, forgotten."

"Perfect." Pell's eyes swept the surroundings with a calculating gaze. "We'll blend right in with the ruins."

They moved quickly, establishing camp within the temple's crumbling embrace. The fire caught on the first strike, and Gond saw tension draining from tired faces. Soon flames crackled in what had once been the main sanctuary, casting dancing shadows across broken columns.

Dax's feet received Sim's gentle attention while Alia helped prepare their meal. For the first time in days, no one glanced nervously at the horizon. The ancient walls seemed to offer more than physical shelter—they promised peace.

As the last light faded from the sky, Gond stood and stretched. His ankle still twinged, but it was barely noticeable. Around him, his people—when had he started thinking of them that way?—settled into the rhythm of evening camp.

"I'm going to scout the perimeter," he announced. "Make sure we're alone up here."

"Want company?" Pell asked, though he was already settling back against a moss-covered stone.

"I'll move faster alone. Keep the fire low until I get back."

Gond set off through the ruins, intending to circle the temple grounds and check for signs of pursuit. But as he walked among the ancient stones, something else called to him. The warmth in his chest pulsed gently, like a second heartbeat.
