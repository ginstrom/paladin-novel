# Chapter 14: The Legend Begins


Gond stood at the settlement's edge, watching the plume of black from the nearest farmstead with unease. Scouts had seen the rows of black smoke marking the slavers' approach two days prior. Beside him, Pell squinted against the morning light, his hand resting on his knife hilt.

The settlement had grown considerably in the weeks since Silviana's arrival. The population had swelled to nearly two hundred souls, all drawn by whispered tales of the "Healer in the Hills."

And that, Gond reflected grimly, was precisely the problem.

"How many new refugees are we getting these days?" he asked.

Pell consulted the tally marks carved into a piece of bark—his method for tracking new arrivals. "Three yesterday. Seven the day before. Word's spreading faster than we can contain it."

The numbers told the story Gond had been dreading. Each healing, each miracle, sent ripples outward through the network of desperate people seeking hope. Refugees told other refugees. Escaped slaves whispered to those still in bondage. Sympathetic villagers passed along rumors to anyone who would listen.

The "Healer in the Hills" was becoming a legend, and legends, Gond had learned, were dangerous things.

"Gond!" Sim's voice carried across the settlement, urgent but controlled. The priest emerged from between two shelters, supporting an elderly man whose clothes marked him as a city dweller—fine fabric, now torn and stained from hard travel.

"Another one?" Pell muttered.

As they approached, Gond could see the man's condition—exhaustion, dehydration, and something else. The hollow look of someone who'd lost everything and was clinging to a final thread of hope.

"This is Marcus," Sim said as they reached the group. "He's traveled from Westport. Three weeks on foot."

Westport. Gond's jaw tightened. That was nearly a hundred miles southeast—farther than any previous refugee had traveled to reach them. The implications were troubling.

Marcus raised his head, and Gond saw tears cutting tracks through the grime on his cheeks. His hands shook as he spoke, and Gond noticed the raw blisters on his palms from weeks of walking with an improvised staff. "My granddaughter," he whispered, his voice cracking with exhaustion. "The wasting sickness. The healers in Westport… they said there was nothing—but I heard stories. A man who could work miracles. Please, I have gold—"

"Keep your gold," Gond said gently, helping Sim support the old man. "Where is she?"

"I… I couldn't bring her. Too weak for the journey. She's with my daughter in Westport, but—" Marcus's voice broke. "She won't last much longer. Please, if you could come—"

"I can't leave the valley," Gond said, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. "We're liable to be attacked—"

"Then she'll die." Marcus's grip on Gond's arm was surprisingly strong. "A child of eight years, and she'll die because I couldn't convince a miracle worker to travel a few days' ride."

The accusation hit harder than any physical blow. Gond felt the familiar stirring of divine power, responding to the old man's anguish, but also something else—a growing weight of impossible expectations. How many Marcus's were there? How many desperate souls making impossible journeys based on impossible hopes?

"Sim," he said quietly. "Take Marcus to the guest area. Food, water, rest. We'll talk more when he's recovered from his journey."

As the priest led the old man away, Gond remained standing at the settlement's edge, staring at that distant smoke. The weight of too many choices, too many needs, pressed down on his shoulders like a physical burden.

"You can't save them all," Pell said quietly.

"I know that." The words came out sharper than Gond intended. "But knowing it and living with it are different things."

They stood in silence for a moment, watching the settlement come alive around them. Children played between the shelters—some born here, others rescued from various horrors. Adults went about the business of daily survival with the quiet efficiency of people who'd learned to make the most of what they had. Guards took their positions at the valley's approaches, weapons ready but faces relaxed.

It was, Gond realized, starting to feel like home. And that made what was coming all the more painful.

"Won't be much longer until the slavers reach the valley," he said.

Pell nodded. "That burning farmstead is no more than an hour away on horseback."

"It's only a matter of time." Gond's hand moved to his sword hilt. "Question is, how long do we have?"

The answer came sooner than expected. A shout from the eastern watch post echoed across the valley, followed by the sound of a horn—three short blasts, the signal for approaching strangers. Not the long, urgent call that would indicate immediate danger, but enough to put everyone on alert.

Gond and Pell jogged toward the watch post, arriving just as the sentry pointed toward a group of figures emerging from the tree line. A dozen people, moving slowly, supporting each other. Refugees, by the look of them, but something was wrong. They moved with the desperate urgency of people fleeing immediate danger.

"Slavers," the lead figure gasped as they reached the settlement's edge. A woman, middle-aged, her clothes singed and torn. "Burned out Millhaven village. Took everyone they could catch. We ran… been running for two days…"

"How many slavers?" Pell asked, already thinking tactically.

"Fifty, maybe more. Professional outfit, not the usual raiders. They had a list." The woman's eyes found Gond, and he saw recognition dawn in them. "They were asking about the healer. They're moving fast, like they know exactly where they're going."

The words hit the settlement like a physical blow. Conversations stopped. Children moved closer to their parents. Hands drifted toward weapons.

"They know," someone whispered.

"We're trapped," another voice added.

"Quiet," Gond said, his voice carrying across the suddenly tense crowd. "Everyone stay calm. We've prepared for this."

But even as he spoke the words, Gond felt the weight of leadership settling heavier on his shoulders. With nearly two hundred souls in the valley, including children and elderly, defense would be a desperate affair. They had to rely on the courage of their few fighters and the strength of their defensive positions.

"Pell," he said quietly. "How long to get out those who can't fight?"

"If we start now? Six hours, minimum. And that's if we leave everything behind."

Six hours. Gond looked at the smoke on the horizon, estimating distances and travel times. He reckoned they had two hours at most. And if they knew about the valley beforehand…

"They'll be here by midday," he said.

"Maybe sooner," Pell agreed grimly.

The crowd was looking to him now, waiting for orders, for reassurance, for another miracle. But this wasn't something divine power could solve. This was tactics, logistics, and hard choices.

"Pell, get the fighters to their posts. Those who can't fight, behind the pallisade." Gond wasn't about to leave the non-fighters undefended again.

The settlement exploded into controlled chaos as people scattered to follow his orders. But Gond remained standing in the center of it all, feeling strangely detached from the urgency around him. This was what he'd feared from the beginning—the moment when his presence would bring danger to those he'd sworn to protect.

"Second thoughts?" Pell asked, appearing at his elbow.

"About what?"

"All of this. The healing, the settlement, playing savior to every lost soul who wanders into our valley." The thief's voice was carefully neutral, but Gond caught the underlying question.

"You think I should have stayed focused on Borin and Kael."

"I think," Pell said slowly, "that a few months ago, you would have been halfway to wherever they're hiding by now. Instead, you're here, about to risk your life for a bunch of strangers." His voice carried something Gond had never heard before—not just respect, but something deeper. "I've worked for a lot of men who called themselves leaders. Most of them only cared about what their followers could do for them."

The observation hit Gond like a revelation. When had he last thought about his former comrades? When had the burning need for revenge faded into something so distant it felt like someone else's memory?

"When did it happen?" he asked, more to himself than to Pell.

"When did what happen?"

"When did I stop caring about revenge?"

Pell was quiet for a moment, watching the evacuation preparations with thoughtful eyes. "Hard to say exactly. Maybe when you chose to leave Blackwater and lead us to this valley. Maybe when you started healing people instead of planning how to hurt the ones who wronged you." He shrugged. "Or maybe it was gradual—so slow you didn't notice until now."

Gond felt something shift inside him, like a weight he'd been carrying for so long he'd forgotten it was there suddenly lifting away. The rage that had sustained him through slavery, through escape, through those first desperate weeks of freedom—it was gone. Not suppressed or controlled, but genuinely absent, replaced by something else entirely.

"I don't want revenge anymore," he said, the words feeling strange on his tongue.

"I know," Pell said simply. His eyes held a glint of something that might have been satisfaction. "First time I've followed someone who actually gives a damn about the people under his command. Makes a difference." He paused, then added quietly, "Question is, what do you want instead?"

Before Gond could answer, another commotion arose from the settlement's edge. More refugees, these ones in even worse condition than the last group. And behind them, barely visible through the trees, the glint of metal in the morning sun.

"They're here," someone shouted.

The preparations, barely begun, ground to a halt. Children began crying. Adults froze in terror, looking around desperately for somewhere to run.

But there was nowhere to run. The valley had only two exits—the main approach where the slavers were advancing, and a narrow mountain pass that would take hours to traverse with so many people. They were trapped.

Gond felt the divine power stirring within him, responding to the fear and desperation around him. But this wasn't a situation that could be healed or blessed away. This required a different kind of intervention.

"Are the fighters ready?" asked Gond.

"Ready? Sure," said Pell. "But we've got maybe thirty who know which end of a sword to hold. Another twenty with hunting experience." Pell's expression was grim. "Against fifty professional slavers? I give us an hour."

Gond looked around at the faces turned toward him—people who'd come here seeking safety, seeking healing, seeking hope. People who trusted him to protect them.

The weight of that trust was almost crushing. But beneath it, Gond felt something else—a clarity he'd never experienced before. This was why he'd been given divine power. Not just to heal individual wounds, but to stand between the innocent and those who would harm them.

"This is our time," called out Gond to the onlookers. "Today we make our stand."

The crowd stirred uneasily. Someone called out, "But there are too many of them!"

"Trust in Alanyi," Gond said, his voice gaining confidence. "Today we learn that sometimes, when the cause is just, fifty isn't always more than two hundred."

He could see the doubt in their faces, the fear that he was asking them to die for his pride. But he could also see something else—a spark of hope, of defiance, of the same spirit that had brought them all here in the first place.

"Silviana," he called. The elf appeared at his side as if she'd been waiting for his summons. "Can you and Sim organize the non-combatants? Get them into the pallisade, and protect them as you can."

Around them, the settlement transformed with desperate efficiency. Fighters took up positions for ambush and defense. Mothers sheparded their children to the pallisade.

"And you?" she asked.

Gond looked toward the approaching slavers, then back at the people depending on him. "I'm going to remind them why legends are dangerous things to hunt."

As the settlement transformed itself into a fortress, Gond found himself thinking about Pell's question. What did he want, if not revenge?

The answer came to him as he watched families helping each other prepare for battle, as he saw former slaves taking up weapons to defend their new home, as he felt the divine light stirring within him in response to their courage.

He wanted this. This community, this purpose, this chance to build something better than what had come before. He wanted to protect the innocent, heal the wounded, and stand as a beacon of hope in a world that had forgotten what hope looked like.

It wasn't the life he'd planned, but it was the life he'd chosen. And as the first slavers emerged from the tree line, weapons gleaming in the morning sun, Gond found himself grateful for the choice.

The legend of the healer in the hills was about to become something else entirely. And for the first time since awakening in chains, Gond was exactly where he wanted to be.

***

The slavers advanced with professional precision, their formation tight and disciplined. Their shields locked with practiced efficiency, spears angled at identical degrees, each rider maintaining perfect spacing despite the uneven terrain. At their head rode a man in expensive armor, his face hidden behind a helm decorated with silver inlay. Behind him came the foot soldiers—hardened men with the look of veterans, their weapons well-maintained and their movements coordinated.

Gond stood at the settlement's edge, flanked by Pell and Lira, watching the approaching force with tactical eyes. Fifty-three by his count, all mounted, all armed with crossbows in addition to their melee weapons. A formidable force by any measure.

"They're not here to negotiate," Pell observed.

"No," Gond agreed. "They're here to collect a bounty."

The lead rider raised his hand, and the formation halted just outside crossbow range. He removed his helm, revealing a scarred face and cold, calculating eyes.

"I am Captain Voss of the Crimson Company," he called out, his voice carrying easily across the distance. "I seek the one called the Healer. Surrender him to us, and the rest of you may go free."

A murmur ran through the defenders. Some looked hopefully at Gond, as if he might actually consider the offer. But Gond had seen enough of the slave trade to know how such promises ended.

"And if I refuse?" he called back.

Voss smiled, the expression cold and predatory. "Then we take you anyway, and sell the rest of these rabble to cover our expenses. Your choice, Healer. Die a hero, or let your followers pay the price for your pride."

It was a clever tactic—isolate the leader, make him responsible for whatever happened next. Gond had used similar approaches himself, back in his mercenary days. The difference was, he'd never been on the receiving end before.

"Counter-offer," Gond said, his voice carrying the authority he'd learned to project. "Turn around and leave. Find easier prey. Because if you attack this settlement, I promise you won't like what happens next."

Voss laughed, the sound harsh and mocking. "Threats from a jumped-up hedge wizard? I think not." He raised his hand again, and crossbows appeared along the slaver line. "Last chance, Healer. Come quietly, or watch your people die."

The familiar warmth kindled beneath Gond's sternum, spreading like wine through his veins, but this time it carried a different quality—sharper, more focused, like molten steel rather than honey. His muscles tensed with sudden strength, and he could feel his heartbeat synchronizing with something vast and implacable. The same divine force that could mend broken bones could also strengthen them beyond normal limits. The same power that could heal wounds could also prevent them from occurring in the first place.

"Pell," he said quietly. "When I give the signal, tell everyone to charge."

"Charge?" The thief's voice cracked slightly. "Gond, they have crossbows. We'll be cut down before we get halfway—"

"Trust me."

Gond stepped forward, placing himself between the slavers and his people. He could feel their eyes on him—two hundred souls looking to him for salvation, for another miracle. And perhaps, he thought, that's exactly what they would get.

"Captain Voss," he called out. "You came here hunting a legend. I hope you're prepared for what you find."

Gond drew his sword. Divine light exploded outward from it like a physical force, washing over the settlement in a wave of golden radiance. Where it touched the defenders, it left them stronger, faster, more resilient. Where it reached the slavers, it did something else entirely—the light seared their eyes like staring into the sun, made their skin crawl with an electric tingling that spoke of judgment and retribution. Several horses reared, their riders struggling to control mounts that suddenly wanted nothing more than to flee from the terrible purity bearing down on them.

For a moment, the battlefield was silent except for the sound of horses shifting nervously and men muttering prayers. The slavers drew back even as they leaned forward, hands reaching out then pulling away, their faces caught between wonder and terror. Then Voss raised his crossbow, his face twisted with sudden fear and fury.

"Kill them all!" he screamed.

Crossbow bolts flew, a dark swarm against the sudden, blinding flare of Gond’s light. The radiance pulsed, a tangible shield, and most shafts flew wildly off course, their aim spoiled by the searing glare that forced slavers to squint and turn their heads. A few bolts struck home, not with the wet thud of flesh, but with sharp cracks as they glanced off shields or armor, the impact staggering defenders but drawing no blood, as if an unseen hand had deflected them. 

Horses shrieked, eyes rolling white, and several riders, caught off guard by their mounts’ terror, tumbled heavily to the churned earth. Recovering with curses, the remaining slavers spurred their horses forward, a wave of steel and leather. 

The settlement’s newer recruits, faces pale but jaws set, formed a ragged line, their pikes a bristling, uneven hedge. Fear was a cold knot in their bellies, visible in the tremor of their spear-shafts, but they held. The charge, meant to shatter them, stumbled against the unexpected resilience of the pike wall, horses shying from the points, riders forced to pull up short or risk impalement.

Then Gond, a figure wreathed in golden light, was upon them. “For the Valley! For Alanyi!” His voice, amplified by the divine power, cut through the din. Pell, a dark blur at his flank, darted in and out, his short blades finding gaps in armor. Lira, her face a mask of concentration, shot one arrow after another into the mass of attackers. The more experienced defenders surged with Gond and Pell, each fighting with the fury of three, their desperate courage fanned into a blaze by Gond’s presence. Slavers cried out as they were dragged from saddles or met by a flurry of blows that overwhelmed their defenses.

Gond himself seemed an omnipresent force. One moment, his sword sang a high, clear note as it parried a captain’s thrust, the next he was a shield before a faltering novice, his light flaring to turn aside a killing blow. He moved through the chaos not as a single man, but as a manifestation of the valley’s will to survive, his presence a rallying point, his light a beacon against the encroaching darkness.
