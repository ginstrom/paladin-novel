# Chapter 4 – Crack in the Chain

The salt wind had teeth that morning, sharpening every sound that drifted across the northern bluffs. 

"The party up the trail," said Pell. We're catching up to them. "When we first found their tracks at the shattered pine back there, we were two hours behind them. Judging by this dung, now we're no more than an hour back."

"This track is too narrow to skirt around them. We'll hold back until we reach the flats, then overtake and circle around in the night."

Gulls shrieked overhead, but the familiar clamor seemed to fade as Gond saw something that made the hair on his neck stand.

Pell saw it too. Crouching at the edge of the trail where a thorn bush bowed toward the sea, he picked up a bit of cloth. "Ribbon," he muttered, holding up a strip of frayed violet cloth. It fluttered like a wounded sparrow in the breeze.

Gond took it, rubbed the coarse weave between forefinger and thumb. *Children's colors.*  The thought knotted his stomach tighter than the sea‑spray chill. He scanned the ground: two sets of small footprints, one dragging slightly on the left.

Sim joined them, loose‑limbed and quiet as ever. "Carts?" he asked.

"Wagon," Pell confirmed, pointing to deep twin ruts heading south toward the dunes. "Iron‑shod. Heavy."

Gond's brand felt hot on his head like fresh coals. Slave‑catchers were near, and children walked in chains. Six months ago he might have calculated the odds and walked on. Today he reached for the boathook slung across his back and felt only resolve.

"Pick up the pace," he said grimly. "We'll catch them right before they reach the flats."

"Are you changing the plan?" hissed Pell. "We'll be outnumbered, and they'll be well armed while we've got a boathook and glorified kitchen knife between us."

Pell looked at Gond's stony face and sighed. "OK, as you wish. Things were getting a bit boring anyway."

#### Laying the Trap

The track narrowed where two limestone outcrops funneled travelers into a rocky choke point. Gond traced a quick map in the sand.

"Pell, you slip upslope, circle wide, and cut their reins when I give the sign. Sim, keep the horses from bolting—quiet hands, calm words. I'll talk our way close, then crack skulls."

Pell's grin flashed like a knife in sun. "Missed this."

They took positions. Gond stood alone in the center of the trail, feigning fatigue, head bowed so his ragged cloak made the boathook look like a simple walking staff. Moments later the wagon appeared: a stout coastal dray drawn by two bay horses, crates of salted fish stacked behind a barred cage. Two slavers rode the bench, bored and confident. A third trudged alongside the cage, whip looped at his belt like a sleeping viper, a crossbow slung across his back.

Through the bars Gond saw them—*a girl, fourteen at most, dark curls matted with grime; a boy, perhaps sixteen, limping badly.*  The girl glanced up, eyes blazing defiance even as she held her brother upright. Both bore the familiar slavers' brand.

Gond raised a weary hand. "Wheel snapped a mile back," he called. "Could use a lift to Blackwater."

The lead driver leaned down, suspicion dawning too late. Gond's boathook snapped up, catching the man under the jaw with a crack that echoed between the cliffs. The scene broke into chaos.

Pell burst from the grass, severing reins and slashing at the second driver. The horses bolted, but after a few dozen yards bent their necks to crop grass, oblivious of the bloodshead.

Steel rang. Gond ducked a clumsy saber slash, drove the boathook butt into a ribcage, pivoted, and swept the bench‑guard onto the road. Pell had a blade in him almost before he struck the ground. Gond turned to the third guard, who was fumbling at his crossbow. Gond charged, causing the guard to shoot wildly. The bolt flew wide, and then Gond was in reach. He swept the guard's feet from under him, then two swift blows finished the job.

Silence descended on the clearing. The entire "battle," if it could be called that, had likely lasted no more than 30 seconds.

The children huddled together, ducking their heads and shivering.

Sim approached them with calming words. As he passed Pell, this passed him a set of keys with a grin. Sim soon had the children free and was examining them for injuries, eliciting information.

Meanwhile Pell and Gond lined up the weapons they had recovered.

One slaver had been armed with whip, crossbow and dagger, while two carried standard mercenary blades, well-maintained but cheap—the kind of cheap weapon men carried when they couldn't afford better. One of the swords was nearly black, more iron than steel by the look of it.

Gond's fingers closed around the leather-wrapped hilt. The balance felt wrong, the weight distributed poorly, yet something about it called to him. He lifted it, testing the edge against his thumb. Sharp enough, despite its rough appearance.

"That one's garbage," Pell observed, hefting the other sword. "Take this one, it's got better balance. I'll keep the crossbow and dagger."

Gond shook his head, sliding the dark blade through his belt. "This one will do."

Pell shrugged, slinging the crossbow on his shoulder. "Your funeral."

Sim set out to recover the horses, bearing a couple of carrots he had found among the supplies.

A sigh escaped Gond—then a crossbow string snapped.

#### Complication in the Dunes

Pain lanced across Gond's upper arm; crimson soaked his sleeve. A fourth slaver—missed in the count—worked desperately at the crank, loading another bolt.

Before Gond could pursue, the girl hurled the loosened chain lock. It whistled past his ear and clanged against rock, missing the man but startling him into dropping his bolt. Her act bought a precious instant; Gond seized it.

"Stay with your brother!" he barked, already vaulting the wagon. Gond sprinted after the slaver, wound blood dripping past his elbow. Sand swallowed the noise of his footsteps; only the ragged sound of his own breathing marked the chase. Shortly he heard Pell's rhythmic breathing a few paces behind, but could not spare a look back.

Halfway across the first dune the slaver fitted another bolt into his crossbow, whirled, and fired again. The bolt hissed past Gond's cheek, close enough to feel the wind of its passing. Adrenaline drowned the pain in his arm, and Gond mustered another burst of speed. The crude black blade he had claimed earlier rasped free of its sheath, rough iron glinting dully.

They clashed atop a wind‑carved ridge. The slaver fought desperately, edges of panic slicing his motions. Gond renewed his grip on the bloody sword hilt; parried, riposted, and disarmed him with a brutal twist. But as he raised his sword for a finishing blow the girl's voice cut through the wind.

"*Don't kill him!*"

Alia—he knew her name now—stood at the dune's base, small hands balled, chin lifted. Behind her Dax leaned on a driftwood staff, blood seeping through a hastily wrapped ankle.

Gond's blade hovered. In the staccato hush he heard his own breathing and, beneath it, the echo of forging hammers—of the life he'd left, lives he'd taken. He lowered the sword.

"Run," he told the slaver. The man scrambled away, discarding crossbow, vanishing into salt mist.

The air settled. Gond sank to one knee as fresh blood oozed from his arm.

#### Refuge at the Way‑Station

By twilight they reached the abandoned way‑station, moss‑covered walls glowing emerald in dying light. Broken statues of forgotten gods lined the courtyard, their faces weathered blank—judging neither the righteous nor the damned.

Sim had coaxed the horses inside the crumbling stable. Pell stacked confiscated crates by the hearth, coins jingling in pockets he pretended not to have. He looked up as Gond entered, children at either side.

Inside the guardroom, Sim cleaned and rebound Gond's wound. Alia hovered, handing fresh‑boiled cloths; Dax recited the knot sequence he'd memorized from watching ship riggers, guiding Sim's wrapping.

"Ah, I almost forgot," said Gond. "Alia—this ribbon must be yours."

The girl accepted the ribbon worldlessly, holding it tightly.

Later, around a sputtering fire, Pell sketched a rough map in the dirt. "Patrol road runs here," he said, dagger tracing a line intersecting the path they had used. "We'll be safe here for now, but eventually they'll widen their patrols. Won't be long until that guard gets the word out," he concluded in a flat tone, avoiding Gond's gaze.

Gond considered the children, the black sword resting beside his knee, the distant glow of Blackwater's lights beyond the hills. "I'll head to Blackwater alone before dawn. I'll take one of the horses. If I'm not back by the following morning, take the children to Maera. She'll find a place for them somewhere."

"Understood, my friend," said Pell. "Stay safe."

"And you."

Alia offered the ribbon back. "For luck," she said.

Gond tied it to the sword's hilt.

Wind rattled the broken shutters, but inside the cracked stone walls the air felt warmer.
