# Chapter 3 – Shore of Second Chances

"Come on," Gond said. "Our path lies ahead."

When his companions hesitated, he extended a hand to Pell, then moved toward the priest. "Cold kills slower than slavers, but it still kills."

"And I want to get out of sight of any ships," said Pell, eyes scanning the horizon.

Sim looked up, offering a nod. "Inland. Freshwater." He pointed toward a gap in the dunes. "Fleabane and thrift cluster near streams—we can follow them to water." His voice carried the quiet confidence of someone who'd spent years reading the land's subtle signs.

Gond filed the information away. The priest's knowledge kept surprising him—not the mystical nonsense he'd expected, but practical survival skills that spoke of a life lived close to the earth. He scanned the debris littering the shore. Barrels bobbed in the shallows, tangled nets draped across rocks, planks scattered like broken bones.

He selected a warped boathook, testing its weight. Pell snatched up a length of wood, shoving the crude club into his belt. Sim gathered barnacle-crusted gourds, shaking each one near his ear before nodding approval.

They followed the thin trickle of freshwater inland, through a narrow gully where the stream broadened into clear, cold water. Pell dropped to his belly and drank like a man dying of thirst. Gond sipped carefully, eyes scanning the ridgelines above. The coast had little more vegetation than sandgrass, scrub, and a few wind-twisted low trees. The lack of cover made Gond feel exposed. The smoke they had seen had come from somewhere beyond the ridgeline, a bit to the left of the trickling waterfall that fed into the basin. Gond again found the smoke, a wispy tendril smudging the grey sky.

The path they were on appeared to lead toward the source of the smoke. It climbed toward rugged cliffs, winding between wind-carved stones. Gond and his party followed it warily, eyes scanning the ridgeline. Just beyond the crest stood a small hut, weathered grey with a slate roof that seemed to blend with the slate hills in which it nestled. There they found the source of the smoke, trickling from the hut's crooked chimney and carrying the scent of woodsmoke and herbs.

Before Gond could knock, the door swung open. An elderly woman stood in the threshold, spear held steady in capable hands. Her eyes swept over them—taking in their sodden clothes, makeshift weapons, the desperate edge that clung to escaped slaves.

"Names. Weapons down."

Gond lowered his boathook. "Gond."

"Pell." The club hit the ground. His eyes never stopped moving, cataloging exits, weapons within reach, the woman's stance—habits learned in alleys where a moment's inattention meant death.

"Sim." The priest spread his hands, empty palms facing outward. "We seek warmth and safety. We mean no harm."

The woman's spear didn't waver. Her gaze lingered on each face, reading something in their expressions—the hollow look of recent captivity, the way they favored certain limbs, the telltale marks of shackle wear. Finally, she stepped aside. "One hour. No longer."

Warmth enveloped them as they entered, along with the complex symphony of a healer's workshop. Bundles of herbs hung from every rafter—some Gond recognized, others exotic and unfamiliar. Thyme and sage dominated, but underneath lay sharper scents: willow bark, feverfew, something that made his nose tingle. A grinding stone sat beside the hearth, its surface stained dark with years of use.

Sim's eyes moved over the hanging bundles with quiet recognition, his gaze lingering on clusters of dried comfrey and what looked like wild garlic. 

The woman—Maera, she said—moved with practiced efficiency. Her hands, weathered but steady, selected specific jars without hesitation. A small goat dozed in a woven basket near the fire, its breathing soft and even. Maps covered one wall, marked with routes and symbols that meant nothing to Gond but suggested extensive knowledge of the region.

Maera ladled steaming broth into wooden bowls, but not before adding pinches of dried herbs from different containers. The broth for Sim received something that smelled of mint. Pell's got a bitter addition that made him wrinkle his nose. Gond's bowl received the most attention—three different herbs, measured with the precision of someone who'd treated similar injuries before.

Gond's hands shook as he lifted the bowl to his lips. The broth tasted of fish and wild onions, richer than any feast he could remember. Around him, Pell and Sim ate with the same desperate hunger, color returning to their faces.

Maera moved between them with efficient grace, binding Pell's bruised ribs with strips of clean cloth, examining Sim's blistered feet, cleaning Gond's wound and the ugly brand on his forehead with a pungent salve that made his eyes water.

"You're a healer?" Sim asked, watching her work.

"Served a temple in Blackwater once." Her voice carried the weight of old disappointments. "Corruption outweighed compassion. Priests of Kemiss conducting slave auctions on the very temple steps, blessing chains with holy water." Her mouth twisted with disgust. "Commerce became more sacred than mercy." 

Gond's jaw tightened at her words. He'd seen those auctions himself—stood in the crowds, watched the bidding, told himself it wasn't his concern. The priests' blessing had made it all seem legitimate, ordained. Just another part of the world's harsh order, like storms or drought. Something to endure, not fight.

*How many times had he walked past those temple steps?* How many branded faces had he ignored, convincing himself that one sword couldn't change an empire built on human misery? The Guild's reach extended into every port, every palace. Even the temples blessed their work.

He'd been a coward. Called it pragmatism, but it was cowardice plain and simple.

Maera glanced at Sim. "You're not armed, while your companions are. Don't you fight?"

Sim's hands remained folded in his lap. "My path is mercy. I heal and guide."

Pell snorted. "How's a pacifist supposed to defend himself from slave catchers? Pray them to death?"

Sim's eyes held steady calm. "Even the tiny field mouse will defend itself when attacked, and Alanyi blesses it."

Maera leaned forward, her fingers pausing mid-stir over the pot. "Alanyi." She repeated the name like tasting wine. "Haven't heard that name spoken with reverence in years. Most prefer Turin these days—justice through strength, order through force." Her fingers traced the rim of her bowl. "Easier to justify the trade when your god values order above mercy."

"The trade?" Pell asked, though his tone suggested he already knew.

"Slavery." Maera's voice carried no emotion, as if discussing the weather. "Blackwater's second-largest industry after fishing. Ships arrive weekly—some carrying goods, others carrying people. The docks have special pens now, built right into the harbor. Efficient."

Gond's knuckles whitened around his bowl. "And the temples bless it."

"Of course they do. Kemiss blesses commerce, Turin blesses order, and both gods apparently smile on profitable ventures." Maera stood, moving to tend the fire. "The salt mines always need workers. The quarries too. Most last six months, maybe eight if they're strong. Short enough to be forgotten before anyone might come looking."

"But some do come looking," Sim said quietly.

Maera's poker paused in the coals. "Some do. And some find what they're seeking." She didn't elaborate, but her eyes flicked toward a small wooden box on the highest shelf—carved with intricate patterns that looked elven to Gond's untrained eye.

"Heal and guide, eh? Then keep these two alive," she said to Sim, returning to her seat. The corner of her mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close.

Gond set down his empty bowl. "We're heading for Blackwater. I have business there. I'm looking for the men who betrayed me, and the inns there will be a good place to start. I've got scores to settle." His voice dropped to a growl. "I intend to collect what they owe."

Pell's eyes brightened at the mention of the city. "Streets full of opportunity. Coin changing hands. Information for sale."

"How far will we get with these brands?" Sim asked, touching his forehead where the slave mark would be visible.

Maera studied their faces with the calculating gaze of someone who'd made such assessments before. "Blackwater's crawling with bounty hunters since the Crimson Company started offering rewards for escaped slaves. Two hundred fifty royals for a branded fighter." Her eyes fixed on Gond. "More if they're wanted for other crimes."

Gond's jaw hardened. "You seem well-informed about current bounties."

"Information travels. Merchants talk. Fishermen gossip." Maera shrugged, but Pell's sharp eyes had caught something—her forced indifference suggested more than casual interest.

"There's a pilgrim way-station southeast of here," Maera continued, pulling out one of her maps and tracing over the coastline with a stick from the hearth. "This is us." Then she pointed at a spot inland. "Old shrine to Alanyi, abandoned now. Stone walls, good water, hidden from the main roads. Travelers used to stop there for blessing and rest."

"Used to?" Sim leaned forward.

"Still do, sometimes. Different kind of travelers now. People seeking… alternative routes." Her meaning hung in the air like smoke. "The shrine's been maintained. Supplies appear when needed. Food, blankets, medicine. Some say it's divine providence."

Pell snorted. "And others?"

"Others say there are still people who remember what mercy looks like." Maera's weathered hands pointed out more details on the map. "The way-station offers shelter, but it's temporary. A place to rest and plan, not to hide. Too close to the roads, too well-known to certain… interested parties."

She paused, her finger tracing the grotto where the way-station lay. "Though I'll grant you this—that particular grotto is unusually well hidden. Slavers have never ventured into it, far as I know. Some say there's a lingering blessing over the place, others claim it's cursed." Her eyes met Gond's directly. "Don't mean to tell you your business, but no blessing or curse will stop truly determined pursuit. The protection, whatever it is, won't last forever."

"And for permanent hiding?" Gond asked.

Maera's stick moved north from the way-station, to a ragged range of hills. "The Thornwood Hills. Thirty miles inland, rough country. Caves and hidden valleys, game to hunt, streams for water. The terrain breaks up pursuit—supply wagons can't follow, and most bounty hunters won't risk the climb." She paused. "But it's harsh living. Winter kills the unprepared, and you'd be cut off from news, supplies, any hope of striking back at your enemies."

Gond's eyes fixed on the map. "Striking back."

"Blackwater's dangerous for branded men, but not impossible. The city's grown fat on slave gold—guards can be bought, officials look the other way, and there are always shadows for those who know how to use them." Maera met his gaze. "But the Crimson Company's doubled patrols recently. They're offering rewards for information. Your faces will be known."

"You're advising against it," Sim observed.

"I'm advising caution. Revenge is a luxury the living can afford. The dead collect no debts." Maera stood, moving to her shelves. Her voice neither rose nor fell, each word measured like coins on a scale. She selected several items—a small vial of dark liquid, strips of cloth that looked suspiciously like bandages, a pouch that clinked with the sound of coins. "But I don't make choices for others. Each person walks their own path."

She pressed a larger satchel into Sim's hands—dried provisions, bundled herbs, and the additional supplies. "The way-station first. Rest, plan, decide. The hills will still be there if you choose them. Blackwater too, though it may choose you first."

Maera then reached into a small, intricately carved wooden box on a high shelf—the same one Gond had noticed earlier, its patterns elven. She drew out a single, perfectly preserved silver-green leaf, its edges almost luminous. She pressed it into Sim's other hand.

"A trifle," she said, her voice softer now. "Something from the Elder Folk. A child's game, mostly." Her gaze met Sim's, a flicker of understanding passing between them. "For you, priest, it may be more. Hold it, when you seek true sanctuary. It might… guide your hand." She paused, a slight smile touching her lips. "And those who carry such tokens sometimes find the shadows cling a little closer, making them harder to follow. A small blessing, perhaps, in these dark times."

Sim closed his fingers around the leaf. It felt cool and smooth against his palm. For an instant, as his skin touched it, he thought he saw a faint, pearlescent shimmer trace its veins, but it was gone as quickly as it appeared. He tucked it carefully into his tunic.

"You've helped others," Gond said. It wasn't a question.

Maera's hands stilled on the satchel's ties. "I've treated injuries. Offered directions. Shared what food I could spare." Her voice carried careful neutrality. "Healers help the wounded. It's what we do."

"Even when the wounded are escaped slaves?"

"Especially then." For a moment, something fierce flickered in her eyes. "The temples may have forgotten mercy, but some of us remember."

Pell had been studying the maps on the wall during their conversation, his thief's eye cataloging details. "Those routes," he said, nodding toward the marked paths. "They don't follow the main roads."

"Pilgrims often prefer quieter paths. Less… crowded." Maera's tone remained neutral, but Gond caught the subtle emphasis.

"And the symbols?" Sim asked, pointing to the small marks scattered across the maps.

"Safe houses. Wells. Places where travelers might find aid." Maera moved to the wall, her finger tracing one particular route. "This path leads to a fishing village where the captain asks no questions about passengers. This one to a monastery where the brothers practice true charity. And this…" She touched a symbol near Blackwater. "A tavern where the owner's daughter was once sold to pay debts. He remembers."

Gond studied her weathered face. "You know a lot about helping people disappear."

"I know about helping people survive." Maera returned to her shelves, selecting a small wrapped bundle. "Take this. Dried fish and journey bread. The way-station should have supplies, but…" She shrugged. "Sometimes supplies run low."

"Who maintains it?" Sim asked. "The way-station."

"Friends." The word carried weight. "People who believe some things matter more than profit." She handed Gond the bundle, and he noticed her fingers bore faint scars—old burns from forge work, cuts from blades. Not the hands of someone who'd spent her life only grinding herbs.

A soft whistle came from outside—three short notes, then two long ones. Gond and Pell's heads snapped up, alert, hands darting toward weapons. Maera's head turned toward the sound, and for just a moment, her careful mask slipped. Alertness sharpened her features, and for that moment she looked nothing like a simple herbalist.

"Fishing boats returning," she said, visibly relaxing. "The tide's turning."

Gond exchanged glances with Pell, who'd caught the same details. The whistle hadn't sounded like any fishing signal either of them knew.

"We should go," Gond said, standing. "We've imposed on your hospitality long enough."

"No imposition. But yes, daylight's burning, and the way-station is a full day's walk." 

Maera opened the door, checking the path outside with the practiced eye of someone who'd learned caution the hard way. "Go south until you reach the old oak with the lightning scar. Turn east there, follow the stream. You'll find the way-station before sunset if you keep a steady pace."

Outside, the wind had picked up, driving clouds across the grey sky. Gond adjusted his grip on the boathook, testing its balance. Behind them, the ocean whispered its endless secrets. Ahead lay Blackwater, uncertain and dangerous.

As they prepared to leave, Maera caught Gond's arm. "The men you seek—Borin and Kael. Blackwater's a large city, but the slave trade makes it smaller. Word travels fast in certain circles." Her voice dropped. "If they're there, they'll hear you're coming. Be ready for that."

"You think they could be in Blackwater?"

"Men like that are drawn to easy money. And the slave trade's been very profitable lately." Her grip tightened slightly. "But remember—revenge is a fire that burns the one who carries it as much as the one it's meant for. Sometimes the best victory is simply surviving to see another dawn."

Gond nodded. This woman had seen enough escaped slaves to know the hunger for vengeance that drove them. Had probably seen what that hunger could do to a person.

"Thank you," he said simply.

"Thank me by staying alive. All three of you." Maera stepped back, but her eyes remained watchful. "The world has enough graves already."

"We make an odd company," Pell observed, adjusting his club in his belt. He had also wheedled an old but wicked-looking knife from Maera, which was tucked into the other side of the belt.

"Odd, but perhaps balanced." Sim watched Gond carefully. "Sometimes the strangest alliances hold the strongest purpose."

The words settled into Gond's chest like stones dropped into still water. He looked at his companions—the warrior, the rogue, the priest. Three men with nothing in common but shared survival and the chains they'd broken.

He turned toward the inland path, eyes stony under jutting brows. He did not look back.
