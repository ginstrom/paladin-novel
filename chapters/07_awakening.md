# Paladin's Rise

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 7: Awakening

Gond continued exploring the ruins as the last light faded from the western sky. He'd intended to circle the temple grounds, check for signs of pursuit, ensure their sanctuary remained secure. But his feet seemed to have other ideas.

Instead of following the outer walls, he found himself venturing deeper into the complex, through half-collapsed archways and overgrown courtyards. The path felt familiar, though he'd never been here before. Each step drew him forward with quiet insistence, as if the ancient stones themselves were guiding his way.

He paused at a junction of three passages, looking back toward the main camp. The fire's glow was no longer visible through the maze of broken stone. How long had he been walking? The moon hung higher than it should have, and his intended circuit of the perimeter had become something else entirely.

The warmth in his chest continued to pulse gently. It had been there since they'd entered the temple grounds, a sensation that seemed to respond to his proximity to certain stones, certain carvings. Now it pulled him forward with unmistakable purpose.

Gond approached the weathered stones, studying the faded carvings that decorated every surface. Symbols of peace covered the walls—intertwined circles worn smooth by centuries of weather, hands raised in blessing, figures kneeling in supplication. He touched one carving, the damp stone cool beneath his fingertips. The warmth in his chest pulsed in response, stronger now.

A doorway loomed ahead, darker than the gathering dusk. His feet carried him forward without conscious decision, down worn stone steps that descended into the temple's heart. The air grew warmer as he descended, carrying the scent of old incense and something sweeter—like wildflowers after rain.

The steps were ancient, each one worn smooth by countless pilgrims who had walked this path before him. Carved symbols lined the walls, growing more intricate as he descended. The intertwined circles of Alanyi appeared again and again, but here they were joined by other symbols—hands reaching toward light, trees with roots that became wings, figures dancing in eternal celebration.

A faint luminescence seemed to emanate from the walls themselves, or perhaps his eyes were adjusting to the darkness. The deeper he went, the stronger the sensation became—not quite light, not quite warmth, but something that touched both sight and feeling. The air itself seemed to hum with barely contained energy.

The chamber at the bottom took his breath away.

Unlike the ruins above, this room remained intact. Stone benches surrounded a simple altar, their surfaces unmarked by time or weather. Carved pillars supported a vaulted ceiling where faded murals still showed glimpses of their former glory—scenes of healing, of hope restored, of light conquering darkness. The air here thrummed with something he couldn't name—not quite sound, not quite sensation. It tasted of copper and starlight on his tongue.

Gond moved slowly through the chamber, his footsteps echoing in the sacred space. The benches were arranged in concentric circles around the altar, as if designed for communal worship. He could almost see them filled with pilgrims, their voices raised in songs of praise and supplication. The memory felt more real than imagination, as if the stones themselves remembered.

The altar drew him like a lodestone draws iron. It was pale marble, worn smooth by countless reverent hands. Symbols were carved around its base—the same intertwined circles he'd seen above, but here they seemed to pulse with their own inner light. Or maybe that was just his imagination. The warmth in his chest grew stronger with each step, until it felt like a small sun burning beneath his ribs.

He circled the altar slowly, studying the carvings that covered every inch of its surface. Here were scenes of Alanyi's mercy—the goddess healing the sick, comforting the grieving, offering hope to the hopeless. The artistry was exquisite, each figure carved with loving detail that spoke of deep faith and reverence.

The compulsion to touch the altar grew stronger with each step. His hand reached out almost without his permission, palm hovering inches from the cool stone. The humming in the air intensified, and for a moment he could swear he heard voices—not words, but the memory of singing, of prayers offered in hope and desperation.

"What are you?" he whispered to the empty chamber.

The silence stretched, broken only by the distant drip of water somewhere in the darkness. Then, as if his words had been a key turning in an ancient lock, the warmth in his chest flared like oil hit by a spark.

His palm touched the marble.

The world exploded into light and sound and sensation.

The chamber blazed with golden radiance, every surface gleaming as if lit by captured sunlight. The murals came alive with movement and color—priests in white robes moving through the space, tending to the sick and wounded. The altar gleamed like captured starlight, and the air filled with the sound of voices raised in harmony.

But it was more than sight and sound. Gond felt the weight of centuries, the accumulated prayers and hopes of thousands who had knelt in this place. He felt their pain, their desperation, their joy when healing came. The stones themselves seemed to pulse with memory, with the echo of divine presence that had once filled this space.

Through the vision, through the overwhelming cascade of sensation, a voice spoke—not heard but felt, resonating in his bones and blood like the tolling of a great bell:

"You carry burdens willingly, Gond. Now carry hope."

He staggered backward as if struck, his palm burning where it had touched the stone. The vision shattered, leaving him gasping in the sudden darkness. The chamber was cold granite again, nothing more than ancient stone and fading echoes.

But the warmth remained, spreading through his chest like wine. The voice echoed in his head, the memory of the voice fading but the words remaining, as if etched in his mind.

Gond sank onto the nearest bench, hands shaking. His heart hammered against his ribs, and sweat beaded his forehead despite the chamber's chill. Exhaustion. Had to be exhaustion. The stress of leadership, the constant vigilance, the weight of lives depending on his choices. Visions were common enough among soldiers pushed too far.

But even as he tried to rationalize what had happened, the memory of that voice refused to fade. The warmth in his chest pulsed steadily, like a beacon in the darkness. And the words—"carry hope"—seemed to resonate with something deep inside him, something that had been sleeping until this moment.

Had he really heard those words? Had the vision been real, or was his mind playing tricks, weaving meaning from the whisper of wind through broken stone? The rational part of him insisted it was imagination, stress-induced hallucination brought on by exhaustion and responsibility.

Gond composed himself, forcing his breathing to steady and his hands to stop trembling. When he finally stood, his legs felt solid beneath him, stronger than they had in days. The chamber seemed smaller now, less overwhelming, as if whatever power had filled it had passed into him.

He climbed the worn steps slowly, each one carrying him back toward the world of fire and friendship, of responsibility and choice.

The main camp came into view as he emerged from the ruins. The fire had burned low, and most of his people slept peacefully around its dying glow. But Sim stood waiting at the perimeter, as if he'd known exactly when Gond would return.

The priest's head tilted slightly as Gond approached, his eyes narrowing with the focus of a man reading subtle signs. Sim's gaze moved from Gond's face to his hands, then back again, cataloging details with the precision of a healer assessing a patient.

"The ruins are... extensive," Gond said carefully, testing his voice. It sounded the same as always, but something in his tone made Sim's eyes sharpen.

The priest nodded slowly, his weathered fingers stroking his beard as he continued his quiet assessment. "Old places often hold more than stone and memory. They remember what they once were." His eyes lingered on something in Gond's expression that hadn't been there before—a subtle shift in the set of his shoulders, perhaps, or the way he held his head.

Gond met the priest's eyes, searching for judgment or expectation. He found only patient understanding, as if Sim knew exactly what had transpired in the depths below but would wait for Gond to speak of it in his own time. The priest's hands remained still at his sides, but his breathing had deepened slightly—the posture of a man who sensed change but would not press for answers.

They stood in comfortable silence, watching the stars wheel overhead. Around them, the refugees slept peacefully under the protection of ancient walls. The warmth in Gond's chest pulsed gently, and he found himself wondering what other changes were stirring within him—changes he could feel but not yet name.

That night, sleep eluded Gond. He lay staring up at the fractured ceiling where stars shone through ancient cracks. Around him, the refugees breathed softly in slumber—people who had somehow become his responsibility, his burden, his purpose.

The memory of the vision played through his mind again and again. The blazing light, the sense of overwhelming presence, the voice that had spoken directly to his soul. Had it been real? Had he truly experienced divine touch, or was he simply a desperate man grasping for meaning in a world that offered little?

"You carry burdens willingly, Gond. Now carry hope."

The words echoed in the darkness, and for the first time since his escape from slavery, Gond allowed himself to believe that perhaps—just perhaps—there was a purpose to his suffering. A reason he had survived when others had not. A destiny that stretched beyond mere survival.

Somewhere in the ruins, wind sighed through broken stone, carrying what might have been laughter—or perhaps just the echo of his own wry amusement. But the warmth in his chest pulsed steadily, like a beacon in the darkness, and Gond found himself smiling as sleep finally claimed him.
