# Chapter 20: The Price of War

The air in the council chamber was thick enough to spread on hardtack, a blend of woodsmoke, old parchment, and the distinct aroma of simmering dwarven frustration. Maps lay unfurled across the long table, weighted down with daggers and whetstones, depicting the Slavers' Coast and the fortified cities that were their ultimate targets. Gond, seated at the head, let his gaze drift over the faces assembled. Each bore the marks of the coming conflict in their own way.

"A direct assault on Saltmere is madness," Thorek Ironheart rumbled, his fist a heavy punctuation mark on the map, perilously close to a spilled inkwell. "But a feint, drawing their main force, while Grimjaw's beauties crack open their western gate? That has the ring of proper dwarven strategy." His beard, braided with iron rings, bristled with conviction. "Strike hard, strike fast. Justice demands no less."

Sim, his weathered hands resting calmly in his lap, offered a counterpoint as gentle as falling leaves. "And what of the innocents within, Thorek? The slaves, the conscripts, those caught in the gears of this war? Alanyi teaches that the path to true victory is paved with mercy, not just might. Can we not offer terms? A chance for surrender before the hammers fall?"

Grimjaw Ironforge, whose own hands looked capable of bending iron bars, let out a snort that sounded like a bellows deflating. "Mercy? Tell that to the ghosts in the slave pits, priest. Some rats need drowning, not a life raft." His gold-capped teeth flashed. "We hit them where they live, break their will to fight. That's the only mercy slavers understand."

Elena Brightblade, her practical armor a stark contrast to Silviana's flowing robes, tapped a slender finger on a coastal fortress. "Philosophical differences aside, our immediate concern is logistics. Saltmere has a deep-water harbor. Taking it cripples their supply lines from the southern kingdoms. But their fleet is formidable. How do we neutralize it without a navy of our own?"

"The elven fleets of old faced similar challenges," Silviana Starweaver murmured, her voice like the rustle of ancient leaves. Her eyes, pools of forest shadow, held the wisdom of centuries. "Deception, coastal raids to draw out their patrols, using the very currents against them. The sea can be a fickle ally, or a devastating foe."

Maera raised her sharp gaze. "My network reports unrest in the guilds of Blackwater. The war taxes are heavy, and the flow of 'goods' has been… disrupted." A faint smile touched her lips. "A well-placed spark there could ignite a fire that consumes them from within."

Pell, lounging in a corner with the deceptive ease of a coiled viper, finally spoke, his voice dry. "Sparks are good. But don't forget who we're fighting. Some are fanatics, true believers in the Slavers' Guild. Some are just hired swords, loyal to the highest bidder. And a whole lot are conscripts who'd rather be anywhere else. Knowing who's who tells you where to push, and where to offer a golden bridge for retreat."

Gond listened, a faint smile playing on his lips. The tension was still present, a live current beneath the surface, but it was the tension of a coiled spring, not a fraying rope. He let the debate flow, guiding it with a quiet question here, a nod of encouragement there. The grimness that had clung to him for so long was receding, replaced by a weary but resolute confidence. The brand on his forehead, once a burning symbol of shame, was now a faded tracery, almost lost in the lines of thought and care.

"So," Gond said, his voice cutting through a renewed surge of debate between Thorek and Sim. It wasn't loud, but it carried a weight that drew all eyes. "We agree the serpent has many heads. Thorek, your desire for a decisive blow is sound. Grimjaw, your urgency is felt by us all. Sim, your call for mercy is the bedrock of what we build. Elena, your pragmatism keeps us grounded. Silviana, your wisdom offers paths we might not see. Maera, Pell, your insights into the enemy's heart are invaluable."

He leaned forward, his gaze sweeping the council. "We will not choose one path, but many. We will be the hammer, and the subtle current. The open hand, and the hidden blade. We fight not just to win, but to build something worthy of the sacrifices this war will demand."

A commotion from the courtyard interrupted him—the unmistakable clatter of armored men and horses. Gond rose, his hand resting lightly on the hilt of his sword. "Expecting company, Elena?"

Elena was already at the window. "Noble Knights, by the look of their banners. Sir Roderick Ashford leads them."

Thorek grunted. "Come to tell us how to fight our war, have they?"

Gond's smile was wry. "Perhaps. Or perhaps they've merely come to observe the 'rabble' in action. Let us extend our hospitality."

***

Sir Roderick Ashford, his polished armor gleaming, dismounted with the practiced ease of a man to whom command was a birthright. Six knights, equally well-equipped, formed a respectful but wary semi-circle behind him.

"Gond of the Valley," Sir Roderick announced, his voice clear and carrying. "We request an audience."

"Granted, Sir Roderick," Gond replied, his tone even, a hint of his old sardonic humor lacing his words. "It's not every day our humble war council is graced by such distinguished guests."

The knight's answering smile was thin, his eyes assessing. "Your 'humble' efforts have caused considerable stir in less humble circles. May we speak in private? Our discussion touches on matters of… delicate alliance."

Gond led Sir Roderick to a smaller chamber, Thorek and Elena taking positions near the door, a silent testament to their own authority. Silviana, a shadow in her forest-hued robes, settled into a quiet corner, her presence a subtle weight in the room.

"You speak of alliance," Gond began, gesturing for the knight to be seated. "Yet your order, as I understand it, remains loyal to crowns that profit from the very trade we seek to end."

Sir Roderick met his gaze directly. "There are many within the Noble Knights, myself among them, who find the stain of slavery intolerable. We believe it dishonors our vows to Turin, and shames our houses." He leaned forward, his voice dropping. "We wish to see it ended. And we believe a coordinated effort is the swiftest path."

"A laudable goal," Gond conceded. "What form of coordination do you envision?"

"We have resources," Roderick stated. "Wealth, influence, access to intelligence within the courts and merchant houses. We can disrupt their finances, sow discord among their leadership, even provide arms and training to those who rise against them. In return…"

"Ah," Gond said softly. "The inevitable return."

"In return," Roderick continued, a hint of steel entering his voice, "we expect that when the dust settles, a proper order is established. One that recognizes the natural hierarchy. Those of noble birth and proven leadership guiding the realm, ensuring stability and justice for all, including the freedmen. Freedom, after all, must not beget chaos."

Gond felt a familiar weariness, but pushed it down. This was not a man to be baited into anger. "And who determines this 'proper order,' Sir Roderick? And this 'natural hierarchy'?"

"History determines it. Breeding. Education. The capacity to govern is not found in every field hand or dock worker, however much we may pity their former plight." Roderick's certainty was absolute, the conviction of generations.

Gond nodded slowly. "I see. You would break their chains, only to fit them with a different sort of leash." He paused, then continued, his voice calm, almost gentle. "In our valley, Sir Roderick, former field hands now forge weapons. Former quarry slaves now learn siege craft from dwarven masters. Women who were once property now command troops and debate strategy. We find leadership in the most unexpected places, once the opportunity is given."

As Gond spoke, his conviction infusing his words, Silviana's eyes narrowed slightly. Sim, who had quietly entered and stood near the doorway, drew a soft breath. For a fleeting instant, to them, the faded slave brand on Gond's brow seemed to shimmer, the intertwined manacles resolving into two luminous, intertwined circles of silver light – the symbol of Alanyi. Then it was gone, leaving only the faint scar. Gond himself felt nothing—no warmth, no tingling, no divine presence stirring within him. The power remained dormant, waiting.

Roderick shifted, his posture straightening as his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. His fingers drummed once against his thigh before he caught himself and stilled them. "A charming experiment in idealism. But a nation cannot be run by a council of… equals. Someone must lead. Someone must make the hard decisions."

"We make them together," Gond said simply. "Human, dwarf, elf. Noble-born and common-born. It is not always easy. It is often loud." A ghost of a smile. "But the decisions are ours, forged in shared purpose, not imposed by birthright." He leaned forward, his gaze holding Roderick's. "We are not seeking to reform the old system, Sir Knight. We are building something entirely new."

Roderick was silent for a long moment, his eyes studying Gond's face as if searching for cracks in his resolve. "You speak of revolution," he said at last, his voice flat.

"We speak of freedom," Gond corrected gently. "True freedom. For everyone."

The knight rose, his hand falling to the pommel of his sword. "Then our paths, it seems, diverge more sharply than I had hoped." He looked at Gond, his brow furrowing slightly as his mouth pressed into a thin line—disapproval warring with something that might have been reluctant admiration. "You are a compelling speaker—and a dangerous idealist."

"Perhaps," Gond allowed. "But we intend to change our ideals into realities."

Roderick gave a curt nod. "When your war efforts align with objectives that serve the greater good of ending this vile trade – objectives we can support without endorsing your… social experiment – my people may offer aid. Intelligence, perhaps, or action against mutual foes. But we will not fuel a fire that consumes the very foundations of order." He turned to leave. "A word of advice. Such radical equality breeds its own resentments. Be wary of those closest to you."

"Thank you for the counsel, Sir Roderick," Gond said. "And for the offer of conditional aid. We will welcome any genuine effort to end slavery, from whatever quarter it may come."

After the knights had departed, their shining armor receding into the afternoon sun, Pell slipped into the chamber. He carried a small, surprisingly heavy pouch, his fingers working it with the practiced ease of someone who understood the weight and feel of different coins.

"One of Roderick's men," Pell said, his voice carefully neutral as he tossed the pouch onto the table. It landed with a dull clink of gold. "A squire, name of Alaric. Seems he thought my loyalties might be… negotiable."

Gond raised an eyebrow. "And are they?"

Pell grinned, a flash of his old self. "Everything has a price, as they say. He offered this for a bit of information. Troop numbers, defensive plans, any juicy disagreements in the council. Seemed to think Sir Roderick might find it useful for his 'conditional aid'."

Elena picked up the pouch, weighing it with the practiced assessment of someone who'd handled many such transactions. Her eyebrows rose slightly at the heft. "Generous."

"Indeed," Gond mused. He looked at Pell. "And what did you tell this enterprising young squire?"

"I told him I'd consider his most generous offer," Pell said, his eyes glinting with mischief. "And that I'd need a bit more upfront to ensure my… discretion." He produced another, smaller pouch from within his cloak, letting it drop beside the first with a satisfying chink. "He was quite accommodating."

Thorek chuckled, a sound like rocks tumbling. "A thief to the end, eh lad?"

"Resourceful," Pell corrected smoothly. He met Gond's gaze. "The gold is yours, of course. Or rather, ours. But the offer… it made me think. If Sir Roderick is looking for information…"

Silviana spoke, her voice thoughtful. "An open channel, even one bought with coin, can be a conduit for truth as well as deception. Or, perhaps, for a carefully curated version of the truth."

Gond nodded slowly, a plan forming in his mind. "Indeed. Sir Roderick wishes to make 'informed decisions.' Perhaps we can help inform him. Pell, my friend, it seems your talents for negotiation are about to be put to a new and fascinating use."

***

The council reconvened, the maps now bearing new marks, new possibilities. The encounter with Roderick, and Pell's subsequent revelation, had added another layer of complexity to their already daunting task.

"So, we feed this Alaric just enough to keep Roderick interested," Elena summarized, "and perhaps steer his 'conditional aid' in directions that benefit us most. Risky. But potentially very useful."

"The greatest risks often yield the greatest rewards," Sim said, his gaze on Gond. "If the information is chosen with wisdom, it can be a tool for peace, even in wartime."

Gond looked at the faces around him – dwarf and elf, human and former slave, warrior and healer and strategist. Each unique, each vital. "We are walking a knife's edge," he said. "Enemies before us, uncertain allies at our flank. But we walk it together."

His gaze drifted to the window, where the valley was alive with the work of a people building their own future. "Sir Roderick spoke of the world's realities. He's not wrong. But realities can be reshaped. Ideals can be given form and strength. What we build here, what we fight for… this is not just a dream. It is the shape of the world to come, if we have the courage to make it so."

A messenger, breathless and dust-covered, was shown into the chamber, bearing dispatches. Gond took them, his expression sobering as he read.

"The Slavers' Alliance has mustered," he announced, his voice quiet but carrying to every corner of the room. "They've fortified their major cities. And…" He paused, a different light in his eyes. "And word from Maera's network. Uprisings in three more provinces. Temples openly declaring for our cause. Even some younger nobles are renouncing their titles and riding to join us."

He looked up, meeting their gazes one by one. "The war is upon us. In all its fury, and all its hope."
