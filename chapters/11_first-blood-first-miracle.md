# Chapter 11: First Blood, First Miracle

The slave catchers' confidence shattered like glass against stone. Gond's ambush unfolded with devastating precision—bolts and arrows whistled from concealed positions, pit traps swallowed horses and riders, coordinated attacks turned the hunters into the hunted.

Gond drew his sword and prepared to join the battle. The blade that emerged from its sheath was no longer the crude, dark iron he had carried for weeks. Instead, it gleamed like polished silver, its edge sharp as winter starlight.

"By the gods." A nearby refugee lowered his bow, eyes wide. "Finally picked a weapon worthy of a leader."
 
Gond flowed through the battle with fluid grace, his blade dancing between opponents while his feet found perfect footing on treacherous ground. Every decision flowed from instincts that seemed to see around corners. When the enemy tried to flank left, he was already there with a counter-ambush. When they attempted to retreat to higher ground, his archers were waiting. The flow of combat spread before him like a map, each move predictable, each counter-move inevitable.

Nearby, Korven fought with the methodical precision of his trade, his blacksmith's hammer crushing armor and bone with equal efficiency. The big man had insisted on joining the ambush party, claiming his forge work had given him the strength to wield weapons others couldn't lift. He proved his point by caving in a slaver's breastplate with a single overhead blow, the bronze-reinforced steel crumpling like parchment.

"Behind you!" Pell shouted, engaging two slavers near the valley's entrance.

Gond spun, his blade meeting the descending sword of a massive slaver captain. The man's strength was enormous, each blow driving Gond back step by step. Steel rang against steel as they fought, the captain's experience evident in every calculated strike.

The slaver's blade slipped past Gond's guard, the point driving deep into his thigh. Fire shot up his leg, and he stumbled, blood flowing freely down to pool in his boot. The watching refugees gasped—such a wound would cripple a man, leave him limping for life if he survived at all.

But Gond fought on, his movements barely hindered. The transformed blade sang through the air with almost supernatural speed. When the captain raised his sword to block Gond's next strike, the silver blade sheared through the steel like parchment, continuing its arc to find the gap between breastplate and helm. The man toppled backward, his severed weapon clattering in two pieces on the stone.

The battle turned decisively. The remaining slavers, seeing their leader fall and their ambush turned against them, broke and fled. Gond's people pursued them to the valley's edge before turning back whooping.

As the last echoes of combat faded, Pell approached Gond, his face chalk-white. "That wound—" He pointed at Gond's leg, where blood had soaked through the fabric. "Gods, Gond, I saw that hells-damned blade go clean through! You should be screaming, not standing!"

Gond looked down, pulling aside the torn cloth. Where he expected to find a gaping wound, only a shallow graze marked his thigh. The bleeding had already stopped. He stared at the minor cut, his brow furrowing.

"I saw it!" Pell shook his head, taking a step back. "That blade went deep. How are you even standing?"

The return to camp revealed a different horror. Overturned pots, scattered belongings, and drag marks in the dirt told the story. Two slavers had crept in during the battle, targeting those who couldn't fight—the elderly, the women, the children. They had fled when they realized that their main force was broken.

But they had left their mark.

Old Henrik lay sprawled near the children's shelter, his body riddled with crossbow bolts. The grizzled former soldier had died defending those he'd sworn to protect, his weathered hands still clutching the broken spear he'd used to hold the slavers at bay. Nearby, a young mother sat propped against a tree, her sightless eyes staring at nothing, blood still seeping from a gash in her chest. Gond recalled that she had just reached the refuge two days past.

Sim knelt beside the children's shelter, cradling his right hand against his chest. His knuckles were split and bloody, and a slaver's sword lay abandoned nearby, its wielder nowhere to be seen. When Gond approached, the priest looked up with pain-filled eyes.

"I had to," Sim said quietly, his voice heavy with anguish. "He was going for the children. I couldn't—" He swallowed hard, his eyes distant with old pain. "I struck his wrist. Just enough to make him drop the blade." His shoulders sagged. "Every living being has the right to defend themselves and those who cannot defend themselves. But that doesn't make it easier." His voice dropped to barely a whisper. "It never gets easier."

And in the center of the camp, young Dax lay gasping in a spreading pool of his own blood.

The boy's chest rose and fell in ragged, desperate rhythm. Pink froth bubbled from his lips with each labored breath. A slaver's mace had crushed his ribs, driving bone fragments deep into his lungs. Each breath was a struggle, each heartbeat weaker than the last.

Sim moved from the children's shelter to kneel beside Dax, ignoring the pain in his injured hand as he channeled what healing power he possessed. Sweat beaded on the priest's forehead, his face growing ashen with effort. His hands trembled, the light flickering like a dying candle.

"He's gone," Sim choked out, tears blurring his vision. "Alanyi forgive me, the damage... it's too much. I can't... I can't do it." His hands fell to his sides, the faint glow extinguished.

Around them, the survivors gathered in a silent circle. Shoulders slumped in defeat. Hands covered mouths to stifle sobs. Eyes turned away from the dying boy, unable to bear witness to their helplessness. Alia knelt beside her brother, her tears falling onto his blood-stained face.

Gond felt a pull he could neither name nor resist. His feet carried him forward without conscious thought, drawn by an invisible thread that seemed to connect his heart to the dying boy. The circle of mourners parted before him, their faces etched with resignation.

He knelt beside Dax, his hands hovering over the terrible wounds. The boy's breathing grew shallower, more labored. Time was running out.

Alia looked up, her face streaked with tears. She reached out as if to stop him.

"Let him work," Sim said quietly, catching her wrist. His eyes never left Gond's face.

Gond placed his palms on Dax's chest and closed his eyes. At first, nothing. No warmth, no power, no divine presence. Just the sticky wetness of blood and the broken rhythm of a failing heart beneath his hands.

*Alanyi,* he prayed silently, the words forming without conscious thought. *If you're there, if this is real, help me save him.*

Gradually, like the first star appearing in the night sky, he became aware of a presence. A flicker of life, faint as a dying ember. Dax's essence, barely clinging to the broken shell of his body, ready to slip away into darkness.

Gond cupped that fragile spark in his mind, breathing on it as one might coax life from the last coal in a cold hearth. He imagined the boy whole—ribs unbroken, lungs clear, blood flowing as it should. He poured his will into that vision, feeding the ember with everything he had.

The spark flared. Grew. Blazed into brilliant flame.

Suddenly, Dax's life force erupted like a wildfire, burning so bright it drove Gond's awareness back, overwhelming his senses with its intensity. Golden light poured from his hands, illuminating the entire camp with radiance that outshone the afternoon sun.

The boy's wounds began to close. Bones knitted together with audible clicks. Torn flesh mended itself. The blood that had pooled beneath him seemed to flow backward, returning to his body as if time itself were reversing.

Heat flooded through Gond's arms, as if molten gold flowed through his veins instead of blood. His palms burned where they touched the boy's chest, not with pain but with an intensity that made his bones ache. The power coursed through him like lightning, leaving his muscles trembling and his breath coming in sharp gasps.

Gond's vision went white. The blazing essence pushed him out, severing his connection to the healing. He swayed, his hands falling away from Dax's chest as consciousness returned in fragments. His fingertips still tingled with residual warmth, and the taste of copper and starlight lingered on his tongue.

When his sight cleared, Dax was sitting up, his hand moving to where the fatal wounds had been. Nothing remained but unmarked skin. His eyes were clear and bright, no trace of pain or injury marring his young face.

Not a breath stirred the air. Even the wind had stilled, as if nature itself held its breath. The crackling of dying embers from overturned cook fires seemed thunderous in the absolute quiet. Fifty refugees stared at Gond with expressions that ranged from awe to fear to something approaching worship. The golden light faded, leaving only the ordinary afternoon sun, but its memory blazed in every watching eye.

"Alanyi's mercy," someone whispered from the back of the crowd.

"A miracle," breathed another, falling to his knees.

An older woman formed her fingers into the intertwined circles of Alanyi repeatedly, her lips moving in silent prayer. A young father clutched his children closer, his eyes wide with wonder and fear. Several refugees stepped backward, as if afraid to stand too close to such divine power, while others pressed forward, reaching out with trembling hands as if to touch the lingering traces of holy light.

Gond staggered backward, his legs giving out beneath him. He sat heavily on the ground, staring at his hands as they trembled with residual power. There was no denying it now, no rationalizing it away. The force that had flowed through him was divine, unmistakable in its nature and scope.

Sim approached slowly, his face radiant. "Now do you believe?" he asked gently.

Gond looked at his hands, still tingling with the memory of that blazing light. He thought of the temple, the vision, the voice that had spoken of carrying hope. All the signs had been there, but he had refused to see them for what they were.

"I believe," he breathed, the admission a weight off his soul. Then, a rougher prayer, almost a curse: "I believe, Alanyi help me."

The priest smiled, placing a hand on Gond's shoulder. "She already has, my friend. She already has."

As word of the miracle spread through the camp, Gond found himself surrounded by refugees seeking his blessing, his touch, his guidance. They knelt before him, reached out to brush his robes, whispered prayers in his name. The reluctant mercenary was gone, replaced by something he had never wanted to become but could no longer deny.

Dax stood and walked to him, his young face solemn with understanding beyond his years. "Thank you," he said simply, then knelt and kissed Gond's hand.

The gesture broke something inside Gond's chest. He pulled the boy to his feet, then looked out over the faces of his people—for they were his people now, bound to him by faith and miracle and the golden light that had flowed from his hands.

He was a paladin of Alanyi, chosen and blessed, whether he liked it or not.

Around him, the refugees began to sing—a hymn of praise that rose to the heavens, carrying with it the hope of the oppressed and the promise of justice to come. Gond stood among them, no longer fighting his destiny but embracing it, ready to carry the burden and the blessing of divine purpose.
