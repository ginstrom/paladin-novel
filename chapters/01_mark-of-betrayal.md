# Chapter 1: The Mark of Betrayal

Gond woke up with the second-worst hangover of his life and a splitting headache to boot. His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth like old leather. Blood, stale ale, and something bitter that made his throat constrict. His forehead throbbed with each heartbeat. The pain was sharp enough to make his eyes water before he'd even opened them.

When he finally cracked one eyelid, pale moonlight leaked through gaps in warped planking above. The surface beneath him rose and fell in a gentle rhythm that sent his stomach lurching sideways. 

*Ship.* The realization jolted him from his stupor.

Iron clinked against his wrist as he tried to sit up. Manacles. He succeeded in his second attempt to rise, punctuated with a soldier's curse. He had to lean heavily against splintered timber that felt damp under his palm.

An itch flared across his forehead. His fingers rose instinctively. They found raised, tender flesh—still raw, still seeping. Heat radiated from the wound. The skin felt thick and ridged under his touch. Gond's breath caught.

A bucket of murky water sat within reach, its surface barely catching the moonlight. Gond stared at it for a long moment, his throat working silently. When he finally leaned forward, his movements were deliberate, almost mechanical. Gradually a face came into focus on the dim surface of the water. Lantern jaw, unshaven. Hawkish nose, badly broken once. Ice-blue eyes under jutting brows. And above them, a brand. 

Two interlocked manacles, each no larger than a copper coin, burned into his flesh with deliberate precision. The slaver's mark.

A muscle jumped in his jaw. His chest rose and fell—too shallow, too measured, nostrils flaring with each careful intake. Gond wrenched his gaze from the bucket and took a deliberate look around him.

The hold stretched before him in the dim light. A collection of hunched shapes chained in pairs. The air hung thick with the smell of unwashed bodies, fear-sweat, and something else. Something that made him breathe through his mouth.

The man beside him had shoulders like a dock worker and fists to match. Purple bruises mottled his face. His thick wrists were chafed where he'd fought his bonds. Air wheezed through his throat, each intake scraping like sandpaper. His eyes flicked open, pupils sharp as broken glass, glancing at Gond before resuming his brooding. The muscles in his jaw kept working, like he was chewing on words too dangerous to speak.

Across from Gond, two figures slumped forward. One sat perfectly still—too still. His head lolled at an angle that spoke of either a broken neck or final surrender. Flies had begun their grisly work around his vacant stare. Tattered silk clung to his frame—once fine clothing now stained with blood and worse.

His companion coughed wetly, each breath a visible struggle. Waxy skin stretched over sharp cheekbones. His chest barely moved with each shallow intake. Ink stains marked his fingertips. A scribe or clerk by the look of him.

*Not much time left for that one.*

Two more bodies lay motionless further into the hold. A woman with farmer's hands and sun-weathered skin. What might have been a young man, though the shadows made it hard to tell. Behind him, someone breathed like an angry bull, all snorts and barely contained fury. The occasional clink of metal suggested a soldier or guard, still wearing pieces of armor they hadn't bothered to strip.

Gond flexed his fingers, testing the chain's give. Solid. Professional work. His captors knew their business.

Memory crept back in fragments. Borin's flushed face raised in a toast at the Prancing Dragon, his voice booming over the tavern's din: "To Gond, luckiest sword on the coast!" A swimming head too drunk after just two pints of ale. Kael's answering smirk as the room turned sideways and his vision dimmed. Those cold eyes catching torchlight as he leaned close, and the last words he recalled before waking up on the ship: "Business, mate. Nothing personal." 

Then darkness.

*Luckiest sword on the coast.* The bitter irony wasn't lost on him. He'd built that reputation by being selective about his contracts. Never worked for slavers—not out of any grand moral stance, just distaste for the business. 

The Slaver's Guild paid well enough, but their work left a sour taste that no amount of coin could wash away. He'd seen their ships before, heard the stories from other mercenaries who took their silver. Always told himself it wasn't his fight.

The Guild was too powerful, too connected. Kings and nobles lined their pockets with slaver gold. Temples blessed their ventures. Who was one sword to stand against an empire built on human misery? Better to take honest work—caravan guards, debt collection, the occasional border skirmish. Clean jobs with clean coin.

*Look how well that worked out.*

Behind him, chained to the opposite bulkhead, sat a wiry man who had the same air of a mercenary that Gond did when he looked in a mirror. Beside the mercenary, close enough that their chains clinked together when either moved, was a slim, unassuming man whose aura of calm seemed out of place. The mercenary leaned forward, catching Gond's eye across the narrow space between them. "How long was I out?" Gond murmured.

"A couple of days. Weren't sure you were going to make it there, mate." The wiry man gestured with his manacled hands. "Name's Pell by the way. And my companion here is Sim." Sim sketched a nod with a wry smile, his chains rattling softly.

Pell jerked his head toward the dock worker beside Gond. "And that lunk chained up to you is Jord." Jord gave a grunt and turned away.

Gond's fingers wandered again to the brand.

"Yeah, you've got one just like the rest of us," murmured Pell sympathetically.

For the first time, Gond looked around and saw the same manacle tattoo on every forehead in the hold. 

Gond's free hand clenched against his thigh. The chain between his wrists clinked softly as a tremor ran through his shoulders—brief, quickly suppressed, but there nonetheless.

The ship creaked around him in steady rhythm. Above, boots scuffed across deck planks, punctuated by coarse laughter and the occasional crack of a whip. When food came—moldy bread and brackish water in filthy buckets—guards tossed it down like they were feeding animals. The dock worker beside Gond lunged for his portion with desperate efficiency. He tore into the moldy crust like a man who'd known hunger before. The dying scribe could only manage a few sips of water before his head lolled back, exhausted by the effort.

In the far corner, a woman's voice whispered what sounded like a lullaby—broken, barely audible, but persistent. Someone else muttered prayers in a dialect Gond didn't recognize. The words were punctuated by the soft clink of what might have been prayer beads. The soldier behind him said nothing, but his breathing had the rhythm of a man counting—perhaps tracking time, perhaps just staying sane.

Those too weak to crawl for their share simply went without.

One guard leaned over the hatch opening, grinning down at them. "Comfortable down there, are we? Don't worry—journey's nearly over. Then the real fun begins."

A second voice drifted down from the deck. "How many you reckon will last past the first month in the mines, Garrett?"

"This lot?" Garrett spat into the hold. The glob landed near the dead merchant's feet. "Maybe one in ten. Look at 'em—half dead already. Salt mines'll finish what we started."

"That scribe there won't see a week," the other guard observed with casual interest. "Betting pool says three days."

"You're generous. I give him till tomorrow's shift change." Garrett's boot scraped against the deck planks. "Course, the strong ones sometimes last longer. Had one bastard make it half a year before the salt ate through his lungs. Kept working right up till he drowned in his own blood."

Both guards laughed.

The dying scribe's breathing hitched. His eyes had opened during the conversation, staring at nothing. A thin line of drool escaped the corner of his mouth.

Pell shifted beside Gond, his chains clinking softly. "Cheerful bunch," he whispered.

"Salt mines," Sim murmured, so quietly Gond almost missed it. "Alanyi have mercy."

"Alanyi? That some kind of god?" asked Gond.

"Goddess," corrected Pell. "Our Sim here is a priest of this Alanyi, although I have to question her power if her priests make a habit of one-way trips to the salt mines."

"Alanyi is the goddess of peace and mercy," clarified Sim. "And I can't think of many places needing mercy more than this one," he continued with a lopsided grin. "Though I must admit, I'd much rather she'd sent me to a nice monastery than a slaver's ship."

Above them, Garrett's voice carried clearly. "Captain says we're making good time. Should reach Blackwater Bay by tomorrow evening. We'll pick up more cargo there and then head to the mines."

"Good. This cargo's starting to stink. Lost two more since yesterday—that woman in the corner finally stopped breathing, and the old man by the bulkhead. Want me to toss 'em overboard?"

"Nah, leave 'em. Reminds the others what happens when they stop being useful. Besides, the smell keeps 'em docile."

A boot kicked something metallic across the deck. "You know what I love about this job? No matter how tough they think they are down there, the mines break 'em all. Rich, poor, soldier, merchant—salt don't care. It eats through everything."

The conversation drifted away as the guards moved to other parts of the ship.

In the hold, silence stretched like a held breath. The woman in the corner had indeed stopped her lullaby. Her chest no longer rose and fell. The old man Garrett mentioned sat propped against the far bulkhead, his head drooping.

The dock worker beside Gond stared at his manacled hands. His thick fingers traced the iron links over and over, wearing a groove in the metal. "Ten months," he whispered. "They say that's the record."

"Don't," Pell said quietly.

But the dock worker continued, his voice hollow. "My brother worked the quarries up north. Said the salt mines were worse. Said the air itself burns your throat, makes you cough blood after the first week. Said the tunnels go so deep you never see sunlight again."

Jord's chains rattled as he turned away.

"The overseers carry whips soaked in brine," the dock worker went on. "Cut you open and pour salt in the wounds. Keep you working even when you're bleeding out."

"Stop." Sim's voice carried quiet authority.

The dock worker's mouth snapped shut, but his eyes remained fixed on his hands.

Gond studied the hatch above. The guards had grown careless in their confidence. They saw cargo, not people. Merchandise that would be used up and replaced within months. The casual way they discussed death, the betting pools on survival times, the complete absence of any recognition that the people in this hold had once been human beings with names, families, lives—it painted a picture clearer than any threat.

A new voice joined the guards above—younger, uncertain. "Sir, should we check on the cargo? Some of them haven't moved in hours."

"What for?" Garrett's voice carried amusement. "They're not going anywhere. Dead or alive, they're worth the same to the mine bosses. Actually, the dead ones are easier to handle."

"But sir, if too many die before we arrive—"

"Boy, this is your first time on this run, isn't it?" asked the older guard. "See, the mine bosses, they order by the shipload, not by the head. They know half'll be dead by the time we dock, another quarter'll die in the first week. That's why they pack 'em so tight. It's all figured into the price."

Something heavy thudded against the deck above. "Speaking of which, time to check the other holds. Got two more shipments below deck. Want to make sure we don't lose too many before we dock."

Their footsteps moved away, but their voices carried back.

In the hold, the silence that followed felt heavier than before. The dock worker had stopped tracing his chains. His hands lay motionless in his lap. The soldier behind Gond had stopped his rhythmic breathing. Even the prayers in the corner had ceased.

Gond's gaze drifted to the hatch. He studied the lazy way the guards moved, how they clustered together instead of watching properly. Sloppy. Overconfident.

He settled back against the hull, closing his eyes. Let them grow careless.

His lips curved in the barest suggestion of a smile.
