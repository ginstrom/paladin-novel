# Chapter 2: Breaking Chains

The ship's hull groaned like an old man's bones, each creak marking time in their floating prison. Gond's skull still felt like someone had used it for hammer practice, but the initial fog had lifted enough for him to think clearly. Around him, the symphony of misery played on—retching, whimpering, the constant rattle of chains.

Days crawled by. Gond ate the slop they tossed down, drank the brackish water, and watched. Always watching. The guards grew lazier with each passing day, their routines as predictable as sunrise.

Jord shifted beside him for the hundredth time, chains clanking. The man's shoulders bunched like a bull ready to charge, and his breathing came fast and shallow. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold.

"You bolt too early, we're all feeding the fish," Gond murmured, not looking at him.

Jord's jaw worked silently, but he managed a jerky nod.

Behind them, Pell watched everything with eyes like a hawk tracking prey. His head turned at every footstep above, every change in the guards' voices—the same predatory awareness that had kept him alive on the streets, reading the intentions of corrupt watchmen and brutal overseers. When he caught Gond's attention, he tilted his chin toward the hatch.

"One of them keeps leaning too far over," Pell whispered. "The greasy one with the gap teeth. Likes to wave his food around, make us watch him eat."

Gond had noticed. The guard thought himself clever, dangling strips of dried meat just out of reach while prisoners strained against their chains.

"We wait for his shift," Gond said.

Pell's eyes glittered with something more than hunger. His weathered hands bore the calluses of rope work, and when he spoke of the sea, his voice carried the cadence of a man born to salt spray. "Know this stretch of coast like my own scars. Grew up working the fishing boats out of Millhaven before I found more profitable work." The bitter edge in his voice suggested that 'profitable work' had come with its own chains—different from iron, but chains nonetheless. "Ship's been angling northwest since yesterday. We're coming up on Widow's Cape—nasty bit of rocks that juts out like a broken finger. Captains always swing in close to avoid the deep currents beyond."

"How close?" Gond asked.

"Close enough to swim, if a man's desperate enough." Pell's grin was sharp as a blade. "And if he times it right. Third watch is when they make the turn—that's when Greasy takes his shift."

"Keep your god handy," Jord muttered to Sim. "We'll need more than pretty words."

Sim's mouth curved in the faintest smile. "She's always listening."

The planning began in earnest the next night, when the guards settled into their dice games and the hold fell into restless quiet. Gond shifted closer to his companions, chains scraping against wood.

"Listen carefully," he breathed, his voice barely audible above the ship's creaking. "We get one chance at this."

Jord's muscles coiled like springs. His fingers drummed against his thigh in rapid, nervous beats. "Just say when. I'll tear through 'em—"

"You'll tear us all into fish bait, more like," Gond cut him off. "Greasy leans over the hatch every third watch. Always the same spot, always showing off his food."

Pell's eyes glittered in the dim light filtering down from above. "Twelve steps from hatch to rail on the port side. I counted. But there's a coil of rope near the mainmast—could trip a man in the dark."

"Good." Gond's mind worked through the sequence like a chess master planning moves. "Sim, when we pass you the keys, free as many prisoners as you can."

"I will." The priest's voice carried quiet certainty.

"Take no more than 30 seconds to free the others, then follow us. We can't save them all," Gond said, the words tasting like ash. "Free as many as you can, but get to that rail within a minute or you're fish bait."

Gond held Sim's gaze until the man nodded reluctantly.

"I'll handle the crossbowman," Gond continued. "Pell, you get the keys and free Sim. Jord—"

"I know what I'm doing," Jord growled, his fists clenching and unclenching in steady rhythm.

"Do you?" Gond's stare could have cut glass. "Because the moment you go up those stairs bellowing like a stuck pig, every bloody guard on this ship knows we're loose."

Sim placed a gentle hand on Jord's arm. The big man's breathing slowed slightly, though his muscles remained taut as bowstrings. "The river finds its way to the sea not through force, but through persistence," the priest murmured.

"River water won't stop a crossbow bolt," Jord grumbled, but some of the tension left his shoulders.

Gond turned to the big man chained to his wrist. "Jord, you follow my lead. No charging, no roaring. We move fast but quiet until we're committed."

"And if it goes wrong?" Jord asked.

Sim's smile was serene as dawn light. "Then we trust that Alanyi guides our path, whatever it may be."

"Trust the goddess, but swim like your life depends on it," Pell added with dark humor.

Gond felt the weight of their lives settling on his shoulders. Four men, bound by nothing but shared desperation and the chains that held them. In a few days, they would either be free or dead.

***

The moment came three nights later. Greasy leaned far into the hold, waving a strip of salted pork just beyond Gond's reach. "Hungry, are we? Maybe if you bark like a proper dog—"

Gond's hand shot up, fingers closing on the guard's rough tunic. One sharp yank, and Greasy pitched forward with a satisfying crack as his skull met oak planking.

"Now!"

Pell moved like water, flowing over Greasy's prone form to snatch keys and shortsword. Steel flashed as he freed himself, then tossed the keys to Sim, who caught them without looking up from his quiet prayers. Pell tossed the short sword to Gond as he climbed past, appropriating the guard's dagger for himself.

"Jord, *wait*—!" Gond bit out, but the big man was already a blur of motion, roaring as he charged upward, chains whipping behind him like anchor rope. Shouts erupted from above.

"Gods-damned fool!" Gond snarled, forced to race after him or be dragged down.

The deck exploded into chaos. Guards stumbled from their dice games, fumbling for weapons. Gond's blade found the gap between one man's ribs before the guard could clear his scabbard. The man folded over, hands clutching his side as he toppled into the rail.

"Over the side!" Gond shouted over the rising din.

Pell appeared at his shoulder, his dagger work quick and merciless. Prisoners poured from below like water through a broken dam, some still trailing chains, all desperate. Gond saw Pell and Sim reach the rail and leap over.

Gond looked around and saw that the shouts had drawn attention. Four guards, armed and wary, were approaching from Jord's left. Jord, intent on bashing the skull of the guard he had grabbed, failed to see death approaching. Gond butted the big man with his shoulder, moving him just enough that the nearest guard's blow was fouled in the lines, but not before Gond received a sharp blow to his left shoulder.

"Get overboard!" shouted Gond.

Then Gond and Jord were up and over. Cold water hit him like a physical blow, driving the air from his lungs. Almost before they hit the water, a crossbow string sang. Jord jerked, the bolt sprouting from his chest like a deadly flower. His eyes went wide, then dim. Slowly he began to sink, still chained to Gond's wrist.

Gond felt himself borne down by the bulk of the big man. He felt an agonizing yank on his injured shoulder, and lost half a lungful of air from the stifled groan. The salt water burned his eyes and nose as he fought against Jord's dead weight. Quickly, he brought his blade down on Jord's wrist. Sawing desperately through sinew and bone, the water around them turning dark with blood. At last the hand was severed. Lungs bursting, pressure causing his ears to ring, he struggled to reach the surface. His short sword tumbled away into the black depths as he clawed upward through the freezing water.

Gond's head broke the surface and he took a gasping breath of cold air that tasted of salt and freedom. Around him, other bodies splashed into the waves—some went under immediately, dragged down by iron weights, their final gasps lost beneath the surface. Others surfaced, gasping and flailing, arms thrashing desperately against the pull of the sea. Crossbow bolts hissed through the air and struck the water all around the fleeing slaves with sharp splashes. He saw the woman with farmer's hands struck in front of him, her eyes wide with shock before she sank immediately, the dark ocean swallowing her without a sound.

Twenty yards ahead, Pell and Sim swam with steady strokes, still wearing manacles but swimming strongly.

The shore seemed impossibly distant, but Gond forced his aching arms to move. Shoulder feeling like it was on fire, Gond found a stroke he could manage with his injury. Stroke after stroke, breath after ragged breath, until his knees scraped sand and he could crawl onto the beach.

He collapsed face-first into wet sand, lungs burning, every muscle screaming. Nearby, Pell rolled onto his back and actually laughed—a breathless, disbelieving sound.

"Well," the rogue choked out, spitting seawater, "that went just... perfectly to plan, didn't it?"

Sim lay beside him on the beach, his lips moving in what looked like prayers of gratitude. His shoulders shook, though whether from cold or relief, Gond couldn't tell.

Gond's stomach cramped violently, and he doubled over, retching seawater and bile onto the sand. The taste of salt and copper filled his mouth, remnants of the ship's foul water mixed with his own blood from where he'd bitten his tongue during the swim. Each heave sent spasms through his already aching ribs and shoulder.

"Easy," Sim said quietly, moving closer despite his own chains. The priest's voice carried that same steady calm that seemed to ease Gond's discomfort. "The body needs time to expel what doesn't belong."

When the retching finally stopped, Gond found Sim kneeling beside him with a strip of cloth he must have torn from his robe. The priest's gentle hands cleaned his raw, bleeding wounds. His touch was warm against Gond's ice-cold skin.

Sim's face appeared to grow dim as Gond's awareness faded.

***

Gond awoke some hours later to see that Pell had produced a rusty file from somewhere, and was applying it industriously to his manacles. 

"Any others make it?" asked Gond. Sim gave a sorrowful shake of his head.

Once Pell was free, he passed the file to Gond. Gond's hands shook uncontrollably—not from effort, but from the bone-deep cold that had settled into his marrow. His lips had gone numb, and his breath came in short, visible puffs despite the mild spring air. Pell took the file back.

"Hold still, damn you," Pell muttered, teeth chattering so hard he could barely speak. His own fingers fumbled with the rusty file. "Gods, at this rate, we'll grow old and die before these cursed things are off. Still better than drowning, I suppose."

Sim waited patiently for Pell to hand him the file, but Gond could see the priest's shoulders were hunched against more than just the cold. The weight of the dead escapees pressed down on all of them, but Gond surmised that for Sim, it would be worse than for the mercenaries who had seen their share of death. The violence of their escape, necessary though it was, seemed to cut at him in ways that went beyond the physical.

"Well," Pell said finally, forcing lightness into his voice, "at least we're not fish food. Though I'm starting to think the fish might have had the easier time of it."

The joke fell flat in the grey morning air, but it served its purpose—a reminder that they were alive, that survival meant moving forward despite the weight of what they'd lost.

***

With the last manacle removed, Gond stood and brushed sand from his clothes. His legs still shook, his shoulder was throbbing, and the world tilted slightly with each movement, but he forced himself upright. Inland, Gond spotted smoke from a chimney, promising warmth and shelter.

He looked at his unlikely companions—the sharp-eyed mercenary thief and the gentle priest—and his chest tightened, then released, as if iron bands had suddenly snapped. Not quite trust, but maybe its distant cousin. They had bled together, suffered together, lost a friend together. That had to count for something.
