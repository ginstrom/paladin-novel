# Chapter 9: Sanctuary Found

Word had apparently continued to spread through Maera's network, and the trickle of refugees remained steady. Each new face brought both hope and concern—more mouths to feed, more lives to protect, but also more hands to build their sanctuary. 

Gond began to notice patterns in their arrivals. The refugees found them too easily, following trails that should have been impossible to track. He knew that if the refugees found them this easily, slave catchers would too. And the refugees would be leading them right to the valley. Still, he couldn't bring himself to turn away desperate souls seeking shelter.

Slowly, the mood of the group transformed into something approaching hope. Sim welcomed the newcomers, organizing work parties with quiet efficiency. Pell took charge of the horses, fashioning crude sledges from rope and timber to haul supplies.

"These beasts are worth ten men," Pell noted, patting one horse's sturdy flank as it dragged a load of freshly cut timber toward the growing cluster of shelters.

The sound of axes biting into wood echoed across the valley as Dax led a crew of refugees in felling trees for construction. His carpentry skills had proven invaluable—within days of their arrival, he'd identified the best timber and organized cutting crews. "Pine for the frames," he called to a group hauling logs. "Oak for the load-bearing posts. And save those birch branches—we'll need them for roofing."

Sim moved tirelessly among the injured and weary, his gentle touch and soft prayers bringing order to chaos. Alia, energized by safety, took charge of foraging together with the other children, their youthful enthusiasm infectious. Lira revealed an unexpected talent for organization, creating order from their scattered belongings.

Among the newest arrivals, Gond had begun identifying useful skills. Korven, a grizzled man with burn scars covering his arms, had worked iron before his enslavement. "Give me a forge and some bellows," he'd said, examining their meager collection of tools, "and I can make what we need. Nails, hinges, proper blades." 

An older woman named Marta had sewn sails for fishing boats. Her weathered hands could work leather and canvas with equal skill. "Proper tents," she'd muttered, studying their makeshift shelters. "Waterproof. These lean-tos won't survive the first real storm."

The sound of hammering had joined the axes as refugees fashioned tools from salvaged metal. A broken cart wheel became iron bands for reinforcing timber. Bent horseshoes were straightened into nails. Every scrap of metal was precious, every skilled hand invaluable.

Throughout the valley, Gond's name echoed quietly. When disputes arose over work assignments, people sought his judgment. When questions needed answers, they turned to him. It seemed that Gond's mere presence was enough to calm tempers and turn anger into smiles. Gond found himself at the center of every decision, the focal point around which their small community revolved. 

Increasingly, people began to notice strange manifestations of some kind of power in Gond. One night, he had his sword out for maintenance—oiling and polishing. He had noticed the quality of the metal increasing gradually since his experience at the temple.

Pell seemed to take notice too. "I could have sworn that old pig sticker of yours was plain iron," he joked. "More suited for hoeing turnips than fighting. But that blade is pure sword-steel or I'm a three-legged mule."

"Just proper maintenance—oiling and polishing bringing out the sword's own qualities," replied Gond. "You should try it on your own sword."

"If I could turn iron into steel by oiling and polishing, I'd be fat and rich."

On one particularly nice evening, Gond addressed the group. "We've found our sanctuary." His voice carried quiet authority. "But safety isn't guaranteed. We must stay vigilant, ready to defend this home."

Pell stepped forward, arms crossed. "We should fortify the entrance to the valley. Make it defensible, discreet. Traps if needed."

Sim nodded. "We build a community of hope, but prepare wisely for those who would destroy our peace."

Murmurs of agreement rose from the gathered refugees, voices strengthening with resolve. Gond watched their faces, something swelling in his chest, not pride, but satisfaction, maybe.

"We each have a role." His gaze moved from face to face, holding each one. "Together, we survive. Together, we thrive."

In the quiet hours before dawn, Gond stood watch atop the valley's highest ridge. Below, the fledgling community slept peacefully.

"It's a good start," Pell murmured, joining him in the darkness. "But slavers won't ignore us forever."

Gond nodded, his jaw set. "Let them come. They'll find more than frightened fugitives here."

Pell's lips curved in a fierce grin. "Then we'll show them what desperate people can do when they have something worth protecting."

Below them, the last rays of sunset touched their hidden valley with gold. Gond felt something settle deep in his chest.

The next day, Pell and Gond-the only members of the group with any military experience-began training the able-bodied refugees in defense. Gond, knowing he had neither time nor weapons for proper military training, focused on teaching pike work-both because pikes provide strong defense against mounted foes and because they enable many inexperienced defenders to group up on a single enemy.

***

A week later, the first real crisis struck.

Gond crouched beside the dwindling pile of grain sacks, his jaw tight as he counted what remained. Around him, the morning bustle of the camp continued—children playing by the lake, adults tending fires and mending clothes—but the numbers didn't lie. At their current rate of consumption, they had perhaps ten days of food left.

"How bad?" Pell asked, appearing at his shoulder.

"Bad enough." Gond straightened, brushing dust from his hands. "We need to send foraging parties farther out. The valley's resources won't sustain fifty people."

Sim approached, his face grave. "I've been thinking the same. The fruit trees are nearly stripped, and the fish in the lake are growing scarce."

"And too late in the season to plant grain," added Pell.

"Come fall we'll be able to gather enough acorns, nuts and berries to tide us until spring. But until then…" Sim trailed off.

The three men stood in uncomfortable silence, each understanding the implications. Larger foraging parties meant greater risk of discovery. But without food, their sanctuary would become a tomb.

"There's something else," Sim said quietly. "The new arrivals yesterday—they brought troubling news."

Gond turned his full attention to the priest. "What kind of news?"

"Smoke on the horizon. Three days' travel south of here. Thick, black columns that lasted for hours." Sim's voice dropped lower. "The kind that comes from burning villages."

A chill ran down Gond's spine despite the morning warmth. "Systematic raids?"

"That's what it sounds like. It's like they're clearing out the whole region. Any foraging parties will be hard to conceal."

Pell cursed under his breath. "So we're caught between starvation and discovery. Perfect."

Gond paced a tight circle, his boots wearing a path in the dirt. His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides as he weighed their choices, none of them good. They could ration more strictly, but hungry people made poor fighters. They could send small, stealthy foraging parties, but that would take too long to gather enough supplies. Or they could risk a major expedition to the abandoned farmsteads two days south—closer to the smoke, closer to danger, but with the potential for significant food stores.

He stopped abruptly, jaw set with decision.

"Gather the council," he decided. "Lira, Korven, and the other group leaders. We need to make a choice, and everyone needs to understand the stakes."

An hour later, the leadership circle sat around the central fire pit, their faces reflecting the gravity of the situation. Gond laid out their predicament with brutal honesty—the food shortage, the approaching threat, the impossible choice between risk and starvation.

"I say we take the risk," Korven declared, his scarred hands clenched into fists. "Better to die fighting than waste away."

"Easy words from someone without children to protect," Lira shot back. "You're talking about sending people into slaver territory."

"We're already in slaver territory," Pell pointed out quietly. "The question is whether we face that reality now or wait for it to find us."

The debate continued for nearly an hour. Korven's scarred fists pounded a tree stump to emphasize his points, while Lira crossed her arms and turned her back when he spoke. Others shifted restlessly, some nodding at Korven's words, others shaking their heads and moving closer to Lira. Voices rose and fell as fear and desperation warred with caution and hope. Gond listened to each argument, watching faces tighten with worry and hands gesture frantically as they weighed options that all seemed to lead toward disaster.

Finally, he raised his hand for silence. "We go. Tomorrow at dawn, I'll lead a party to the Thornfield farmstead. It's been abandoned for weeks—the refugees who told us about it said the family fled when the raids started. Their root cellars might still be intact."

"How many?" Pell asked.

"Twelve. Enough to carry significant supplies, few enough to move quietly." Gond's gaze swept the circle. "Volunteers only. No one with children under ten. No one who can't run if we need to."

Sim leaned forward. "The smoke they saw—how far from Thornfield?"

"Close enough to be dangerous. Far enough that we might have a chance." Gond stood, his decision made. "We leave before dawn. We'll travel fast, raid the farm that night, load what we can find, and get back before nightfall the next day. Two days, in and out."

As the council dispersed to spread word of the expedition, Gond found himself staring south toward the horizon. Somewhere out there, smoke still rose from burning homes. Somewhere out there, slavers moved with methodical precision, destroying everything in their path.

And tomorrow, he would lead his people directly toward that danger.

The irony wasn't lost on him. A week ago, he'd promised them sanctuary. Now he was asking them to risk everything on a desperate gamble for survival.

"Second thoughts?" Pell asked, settling beside him on the rocky outcrop.

"Third and fourth thoughts," Gond admitted. "But the alternative is watching them starve."

"Could be walking into a trap. Could be the farmstead's already been hit."

"Could be." Gond's hand moved unconsciously to his sword hilt. "But we won't know until we look."

Pell nodded slowly. "Then we'd better make sure we're ready for whatever we find."

As evening fell over the valley, Gond stood before the assembled refugees once more. But this time, instead of promises of safety, he offered them truth—harsh, uncompromising, and necessary.

"Tomorrow, some of us risk everything so all of us can survive," he said, his voice carrying to every corner of the gathering. "That's what family does. That's what we've become."

The faces looking back at him showed fear, yes, but also determination. Gond gave a satisfied nod.
