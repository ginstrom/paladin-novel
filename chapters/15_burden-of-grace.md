# Chapter 15: Burden of Grace

The victory had come at a price.

Gond knelt beside the still form of young Willem, one of the settlement's newest arrivals—a boy of perhaps sixteen who'd taken up a sword for the first time in his life three hours ago. Now he lay motionless on the bloodstained grass, his chest rising and falling in shallow, labored breaths.

"Internal bleeding," Sim said quietly, his hands already stained red from his examination. "The crossbow bolt went deep. I've done what I can, but..."

But it wasn't enough. Gond could see that much without divine sight. The boy's skin had taken on the waxy pallor that spoke of life ebbing away, and his breathing grew more ragged with each passing moment.

Around them, the settlement bore the scars of battle. The slavers had been routed—those who survived the initial charge had fled into the forest, leaving behind their dead and wounded. Captain Voss himself lay among the fallen, his expensive armor no protection against the fury of people fighting for their homes.

It should have been a moment of triumph. Instead, Gond's shoulders sagged as if invisible stones had been piled upon them, each fallen defender adding to the burden that pressed down on his spine.

"How many?" he asked.

"Seven dead," Pell reported, his voice carefully neutral. "Twelve wounded, three seriously. Including young Willem." He paused. "Could have been much worse."

Could have been. But Willem was dying, and two other defenders lay nearby in grave condition, though not immediately life threatening.

Gond placed his hands on Willem's chest, feeling for the familiar stirring of divine power. It came readily, flowing through him like warm honey. The divine light sought out the damaged places within the boy's body—the internal bleeding, the shattered ribs, the trauma that went deeper than flesh.

The healing began, golden light suffusing Willem's broken form. Gond felt the boy's wounds responding, blood vessels mending, bones knitting together. For a moment, hope flared in his chest. Willem's breathing steadied, color returning to his pale cheeks.

Then, like a gentle but unmistakable pressure against his consciousness, came Alanyi's voice: *Ease his suffering, my son. But his path ends here. Provide comfort, not healing. His spirit yearns for release.*

Gond's hands trembled. The divine instruction was clear, undeniable. But Willem was so young, had fought so bravely. Surely the goddess would want him to live, to see the world they were building.

"No," Gond whispered, pouring more power into the healing. "I can save him. I can—"

The warmth that had filled his chest suddenly drained away, leaving behind a hollow ache that echoed with each heartbeat. His fingertips, which had tingled with divine energy moments before, now felt cold and numb. The golden light flickered and died, abandoning him to channel his own mortal will against death itself. Sweat beaded on Gond's forehead as he fought to continue the healing without divine support. The effort was enormous, like trying to hold back an ocean with his bare hands. His vision blurred, his hands shook, and he felt something fundamental within himself beginning to tear.

Around him, he could hear voices—Sim urging him to stop, Silviana speaking urgently in elven, others calling out in alarm as they saw him collapsing.

Willem's eyes fluttered open, meeting Gond's for a brief moment. The boy's lips moved, forming words too quiet to hear. Then his chest stilled, and the light faded from his gaze.

Gond's hands fell away as consciousness fled. He collapsed beside Willem's body.

The crowd that had gathered around them began to disperse, some weeping, others offering quiet prayers. 

Gond regained consciousness in the healer's tent. Sim was sitting beside him.

"Where are the other wounded?" asked Gond.

Sim's expression was pained. "You've been out for five days. Silviana and I together were able to save Peska, but Sif..."

Gond closed his eyes. The corners of his mouth drew back in a grimace.

"You did everything you could," Sim said gently.

"Did I?" Gond's voice was raw. "She told me to stop. Alanyi herself told me to let him go, to ease his suffering and let his spirit find peace. But I thought I knew better. I thought I could defy divine will and save him anyway. And because of my pride," he continued bitterly, "Sif died too."

"Gond—"

"Nine people died today because they believed in me. Because they thought the 'Healer in the Hills' could protect them from anything." He looked up at Sim, his eyes hollow. "And when the goddess herself gave me clear instruction, I ignored it. What kind of paladin does that make me?"

Before Sim could answer, Silviana spoke up. The elf's usually serene expression was troubled, her ancient eyes reflecting a pain that went deeper than the day's losses.

"Come," she said simply. "There is something you need to see."

She led him away from the battlefield, through the settlement and up the slope toward the old temple ruins where they'd first practiced channeling divine power. Gond followed, still weak but able to walk. Instead of stopping at their usual meditation spot, Silviana continued climbing, following a path Gond had never noticed before.

The trail wound through dense forest, marked only by occasional stones that seemed to have been placed with deliberate care. As they climbed higher, the sounds of the settlement faded below them, replaced by the whisper of wind through ancient trees.

"Where are we going?" Gond asked.

"To a place of answers," Silviana replied. "Or perhaps, to a place where the right questions become clear."

They emerged into a circular clearing dominated by a single massive oak tree. The bark was deeply furrowed, each groove and ridge telling the story of countless seasons. The scent of rich earth and growing things filled the air, while overhead, the canopy rustled with a sound like distant voices sharing ancient secrets. The tree's branches spread overhead like a living cathedral, and at its base, carved into the bark itself, was a symbol Gond recognized—the intertwined circles of Alanyi, goddess of mercy and redemption.

"Every paladin of Alanyi has a tree that marks their connection," said Silviana without preamble. "Alanyi bid me to carve this symbol for you, making this your tree."

Gond approached the tree slowly, his fingers tracing the worn grooves of the carving. The bark felt warm beneath his touch, as if life pulsed just beneath the surface. "How many paladins have there been?"

"Fewer than you might think. More than the world remembers." Silviana's voice carried the weight of centuries. "Each one faced the same crisis you face now—the moment when divine power proves insufficient to prevent all suffering, when the burden of choice becomes too heavy to bear."

"And what happened to them?"

"Some broke under the weight. They abandoned their calling, convinced they were unworthy of divine grace." Silviana's eyes were distant, remembering. "Others became consumed by their power, believing themselves above mortal concerns. Both paths lead to the same destination—the loss of what makes a paladin truly effective."

Gond sank down beside her, his back against the ancient bark. "And the rest?"

"They learned the hardest lesson of all—that divine power is not about preventing all suffering, but about trusting divine wisdom even when it conflicts with mortal compassion. That being a paladin means accepting that the gods see patterns we cannot, and sometimes mercy means letting go."

The words hit Gond like physical blows. "So I'm supposed to just accept that Willem died? That I defied Alanyi's direct instruction because I thought I knew better?"

"You are supposed to accept that Willem died because it was his time, and Alanyi knew his spirit was ready for release. That seven good people died because they chose to stand against evil, knowing the cost." Silviana turned to face him, her expression gentle but implacable. "Your defiance was not malice, Gond—it was love. But divine wisdom encompasses more than mortal understanding."

"But I nearly died trying to save him—"

"And that taught you something crucial about the relationship between divine will and mortal desire." She placed a hand on his shoulder. "The gods do not give us power to override their judgment, but to serve their greater purpose. The question is not whether you can save everyone—it is whether you will learn to trust divine guidance even when your heart rebels against it."

Gond closed his eyes, feeling the weight of her words settle over him. In the distance, he could hear the sounds of the settlement—people rebuilding, tending to the wounded, preparing for whatever came next. They were continuing on despite their losses, finding strength in each other and in the hope he'd helped kindle. He stayed there for a long time, the ancient oak a silent witness to his turmoil. Eventually, he rose, the stiffness in his limbs a dull echo of the ache in his spirit, and made his way back down to the valley.

***

Two days later, the raw edge of grief had settled into a heavy quiet that lay over the valley like the morning mist. Nine fresh mounds of earth marked the resting place of those who had fallen defending their new home. Gond stood before them as the first light of dawn touched the peaks, the air cold and still. He had visited at dusk the day before, and again now, a silent vigil for Willem, for Sif, for the seven others whose names were now etched into the valley's memory. His shoulders were slumped, not from physical exhaustion, but from a weariness that settled deep in his bones. He ran a hand over the rough wood of a hastily made grave marker, the name 'Willem' barely legible.

A twig snapped behind him.

Gond’s body tensed as he turned.

A figure emerged from the tree line—a dwarf, but unlike any he'd encountered before. This one wore armor that gleamed with more than mere polish, inscribed with runes that seemed to shift and flow in the pale light. His beard was iron-gray, braided with small metal rings that chimed softly as he moved. In his hands, he carried a warhammer that radiated an aura of barely contained power.

The dwarf’s gaze took in the scene – the fresh graves, Gond’s solitary figure. "A heavy price for peace, it seems." His voice was rough, accented with the cadence of mountain folk.

Gond’s hand remained on his sword. "Who are you?"

"Thorek Ironheart, of the Iron Covenant." The dwarf’s eyes fixed on Gond with an intensity that was almost physical. "Word reached us of a battle here. And of a man leading the defense, a paladin of Alanyi, some said." He gestured to the graves. "I see I was late to the dance, but the music lingers."

Gond’s posture didn’t ease. "And what do you find, now that you're here?"

Thorek studied him for a long moment, his eyes moving from Gond's face, still etched with sleeplessness and sorrow, to the sword at his side. The dwarf's expression shifted, a flicker of professional interest replacing his initial assessment.

"May I?" Thorek gestured toward the weapon.

Gond hesitated, then drew his blade and offered it hilt-first. The silver steel caught the dawn light, its surface unmarked despite the battle.

Thorek took the sword with the reverence of a master craftsman, his calloused fingers running along the fuller, testing the balance, examining the edge with an expert's eye. His breathing grew shallow as he studied the weapon, turning it this way and that. The dwarf's weathered hands traced the blade's surface with the delicate touch of someone who understood metal at its most fundamental level. He held it up, squinted at the grain of the steel, even brought it close to his ear and tapped it gently with one thick finger, listening to the tone it produced.

"By Turin's hammer," he whispered, his voice filled with awe. "This is no mortal blade."

"What do you mean?" Gond asked, his own weariness momentarily forgotten.

The dwarf looked up, his eyes wide with something approaching religious fervor. "I have worked metal for over two centuries, lad. I have forged weapons for kings and heroes, blades that have carved their names into legend. But this..." He held the sword up, watching light play along its perfect edge. "The steel is too pure, the balance too perfect. The edge holds a sharpness that should be impossible to maintain. And the way it resonates when struck—it sings with harmonics I've never heard from earthly metal. This is beyond my ability to forge. Beyond any mortal smith's ability."

"Silviana spoke of weapons transformed by divine will," Gond murmured.

"Silviana is right," Thorek replied, carefully returning the weapon to Gond's hands, "You carry a blade touched by the divine. The steel itself has been blessed, transformed into something that exists as much in the realm of spirit as in the world of flesh."

Gond stared at the sword, remembering the sword's seeming transformation from iron to silver sword-steel.

Thorek looked from the sword to the graves, then back to Gond. "I came seeking a paladin. I find a man who stands guard over the fallen, who bears the weight of their loss. I find someone willing to spend his own life force to heal the wounded, even when it costs him. I find a leader who grieves for those he could not save." The dwarf's expression softened slightly. "I find a paladin, though one who has learned the hard way that even divine champions need allies."

"Allies?" Gond’s voice was flat.

"The Iron Covenant has watched the corruption of the Marshal Order for two centuries," Thorek said, his voice carrying the weight of old anger. "We have seen Turin's teachings twisted to serve those who would enslave the innocent. It began when the kingdom banned worship of Gorlatch—the old evil god—and his followers went underground, infiltrating other orders. The corruption spread like poison through the ranks." His expression darkened. "We have waited for a sign that the old alliance between our peoples might be renewed."

He stepped forward, extending his hand to Gond. "Your victory here was not won by divine power alone. It was won by people standing together, fighting for something greater than themselves. That is the true strength of a paladin—not the miracles you can work, but the hope you can inspire in others."

Gond looked at the offered hand. Slowly, he reached out and clasped the dwarf's forearm in the traditional warrior's greeting. As their hands met, Thorek spoke a phrase in the old dwarven tongue, his voice carrying the weight of ritual and ceremony. The metal rings in his beard chimed softly, and for a moment, the air itself seemed to thrum with significance.

"The Iron Covenant offers its aid," Thorek said formally. "Our weapons, our knowledge, our strength in the battles to come. But more than that, we offer partnership—the chance to rebuild what was broken, to restore the alliance that once stood against the darkness."

"And in return?"

Thorek's smile was fierce and proud. "In return, you continue being what you are—a beacon of hope in a world that has forgotten what hope looks like. You stand against the slavers and their corrupt allies. You show the world that divine power still flows to those worthy of it."

Gond felt something shift inside him—not the divine power he'd grown accustomed to, but something more fundamental. The crushing weight of solitary responsibility began to ease, replaced by the strength that came from shared purpose.

"There will be more battles," he said.

"Aye, there will."

"More losses. More hard choices."

"Aye. But you will not make them alone."

Gond looked towards the settlement, where the sounds of life were beginning to stir. Smoke rose from cooking fires, and the distant clang of a hammer on metal spoke of rebuilding.

It wasn't perfect. It wasn't safe. But it was real, and it was worth fighting for.

"When do we start?" he asked.

Thorek's grin was answer enough.

***

The war council convened that evening around the central fire, the flickering flames casting dancing shadows across the faces of those gathered. Gond sat with Thorek on his right and Silviana—who had greeted the dwarf’s arrival with quiet understanding earlier in the day—on his left. Pell, Sim, and Lira completed the circle. Around them, the settlement had settled into its nightly routines, but there was an undercurrent of anticipation in the air, fueled by the news of the dwarf’s arrival and the alliance he brought.

"The attack by the slavers was not random," Thorek said without preamble. "The Crimson Company is—was—one of the most professional slaver outfits on the continent. They don't move without significant payment and solid intelligence."

"Someone hired them specifically to take me," Gond said. It wasn't a question.

"Aye. And when they failed to return, their employers will send others. Larger forces, better equipped, more ruthless." The dwarf's expression was grim. "You have perhaps a month before the next attack. Maybe less."

"Then we need to be ready," Pell said. "Better defenses, more fighters, escape routes—"

"No." Gond's voice cut through the planning session. "No more running. No more hiding."

The circle fell silent, all eyes turning to him. In the firelight, Gond could see the question in their faces—the same question he'd been asking himself since Willem's death.

"We've been reacting," he continued. "Waiting for them to come to us, trying to protect what we've built. But that's not enough anymore. It will never be enough as long as the slave trade exists."

"What are you suggesting?" Silviana asked, though her tone suggested she already knew.

"I'm suggesting we stop playing defense and start taking the fight to them." Gond looked around the circle, meeting each pair of eyes in turn. "The slavers, their backers, the corrupt officials who enable them—all of it. We tear it down and build something better in its place."

Thorek leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with interest. "That's not a battle, lad. That's a war."

"Then it's a war." Gond's voice carried a certainty he hadn't felt since Willem's death. "A war for the right of people to live without fear of chains."

"The Iron Covenant has been preparing for such a war for two centuries," Thorek said slowly. "We have weapons, siege engines, warriors trained in the old ways. But we have lacked something crucial—a cause that could unite the scattered forces of good."

"And now?" Sim asked.

The dwarf's smile was fierce and proud. "Now we have a paladin."

As the council continued late into the night, planning and preparing for the battles to come, Gond felt the last of his doubt fade away. Willem's death still grieved him, and he knew there would be more losses ahead. But he also knew that the boy's sacrifice—and the sacrifice of all who had fallen—would not be in vain.
