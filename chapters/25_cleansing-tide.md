# Chapter 25: The Cleansing Tide

The dawn over Saltmere broke red and angry, its crimson light reflecting off the steel of weapons and the grim faces of soldiers who had watched their delegation murdered in cold blood. Hands gripped sword hilts with white knuckles. Jaws clenched tight enough to make teeth ache. The betrayal had stripped away any lingering hope for a peaceful resolution; only the hard language of steel and divine fire remained. Gond stood upon a makeshift platform of siege engine timbers, his gaze fixed on the city that had become a festering wound on Alanyi's coast.

"They picked their side," Gond's voice, boosted by a touch of Alanyi's power, cut through the morning air. "They chose the shadows. Today, they learn what that choice costs. Today, Alanyi's light comes back to Saltmere!"

A roar answered him, a wave of sound from human, dwarf, and elf alike. Grimjaw's engines, "Hope's Hammer" and "Alanyi's Judgment," thundered their assent, hurling massive stones against the already battered ramparts. This was the signal.

## The Hammer of Justice

Silviana's ancient knowledge had revealed the hidden ways, tunnels carved when the world was younger, leading beneath Saltmere's western flank, towards the rumored Sunken Grotto. While Grimjaw's bombardment drew the defenders' eyes to the main gates, Gond led a strike force of five hundred—his own veterans, Sir Marcus's repentant knights, and a formidable company of Thorek's Iron Covenant dwarves—into the damp darkness.

The tunnels opened into a series of vast cisterns beneath the city. The air was thick with the stench of stagnant water and something fouler, something that spoke of Gorlatch's taint. They emerged into the slave quarter, the element of surprise absolute. The fighting erupted in narrow confines—steel rang against steel in doorways barely wide enough for two men, boots slipped on blood-slicked cobblestones, and the screams of the wounded echoed off crumbling tenement walls. Warriors pressed shoulder to shoulder, unable to swing their weapons in full arcs, reduced to stabbing thrusts and desperate grappling. Gond's sword, blazing with Alanyi's light, was a beacon in the chaos, his presence bolstering his warriors, his strikes felling slaver guards and Gorlatch cultists with terrible efficiency.

The battle for Saltmere became a grinding advance. A contingent branched off to take the walls, and Elena Brightblade's main force, seeing the pre-arranged smoke signal from the gates, launched their assault. The true turning point came at the Grand Market, a sprawling plaza that had become a fortified slaver stronghold. Gond's forces were pinned down by heavy crossbow fire from barricaded merchant houses.

It was then the dwarves made their mark. Thorek's cousin, Borin Stonebeard, his knuckles white around his warhammer's grip and his beard bristling with barely contained rage from his recent ordeal, led his Iron Covenant warriors in a seemingly suicidal charge. Not directly at the barricades, but at the foundations of the largest slaver-held building. With mighty swings of their warhammers, the dwarves smashed through stone and timber. The structure groaned, then collapsed inwards with a deafening roar, taking dozens of defenders with it and sowing chaos among the rest.

"Alanyi's mercy for the oppressed!" Gond roared, seizing the moment. "Turin's justice for the oppressor!" He led the charge through the dust and confusion. The slavers' line broke.

By midday, the fight had reached the desecrated Sunken Grotto. What had once been a place of healing waters was now a pit of filth and despair, Gorlatch's symbols defiling every surface. Here, the resistance was fanatical, led by priests of the chained god. But Gond, his power fueled by righteous anger and Alanyi's sorrow, was an unstoppable force. The Grotto was reclaimed, its dark energies scoured by divine light.

As the sun began to dip towards the sea, Saltmere fell. The last pockets of resistance were crushed. Sim, tears streaming down his face, began the first rites of purification in the Grotto, Silviana at his side, her elven chants weaving with his human prayers. The liberation of slaves, a tide of humanity blinking in newfound freedom, began under Elena's organized command. Saltmere, the first jewel of the Slavers' Coast, was cleansed.

***

In the hours following Saltmere's fall, as Sim and his acolytes worked to purify the Sunken Grotto, Gond walked among the wounded. Not just his own soldiers, but the enemy casualties as well. It was something that had become his practice—to offer healing even to those who had fought against him, if they would accept it.

Most of the slaver defenders were beyond help, their wounds too severe or their spirits already departed. But in a narrow alley near the Grand Market, he found a figure slumped against a bloodstained wall, breathing shallow and labored.

The man's face was turned away, but something about his build, the way he held himself even in defeat, struck Gond as familiar. When the wounded fighter looked up, recognition hit like a physical blow.

"Kael."

His former friend's eyes widened, then closed as if in pain that had nothing to do with his wounds. "Gond. I… I didn't think you'd come this way."

Gond knelt beside him, taking in the severity of the injuries. A deep sword thrust to the side, blood loss, infection already setting in. Without intervention, Kael would be dead within the hour.

"You came back," Gond said, his voice quiet, more sad than angry. "After we gave you Alanyi's mercy. You came back to fight for *them*."

Kael coughed, a wet, bloody sound. "What else was I gonna do, Gond? You set us free, sure, but you didn't exactly roll out the welcome mat. Mercenary work? It's all I know."

"So you picked the slavers." Not a question, a flat statement.

"I picked eating," Kael rasped. "Coin in my purse, a roof over my head. Told myself it was just a job. But when the fighting started…" He gestured feebly at his side. "Killing unarmed slaves isn't battle, it's murder. I hesitated. And hesitation'll kill you in this business."

Gond felt the familiar warmth building in his chest, Alanyi's power responding to the pain—not just physical, but spiritual—that radiated from his former friend. He could heal these wounds. The question was whether he should.

"Do you want to live, Kael?" Gond asked, his voice surprisingly gentle.

Kael’s eyes searched his. "Why ask? You'll do what you think is right. Always did."

"Maybe. But I'm asking."

A long pause. "Yeah," Kael breathed. "Yeah, I want to live. Not 'cause I deserve it. Just... I'm tired, Gond. Tired of this life, selling my sword to whoever's buying, no questions asked."

Gond placed his hands on Kael's wounded side. The divine power flowed through him, seeking out the damaged tissue. But Kael's connection to Alanyi was weak, making the conduit difficult to form. Gond drew from Kael's own reserves-his will to live-to maintain the conduit to Alanyi's divine power, fighting back the infection, knitting torn flesh together. Kael gasped as the pain flaired, then receded, his breathing steadying.

"Why?" Kael whispered, the healing light fading. "After all of it... the betrayal, me fighting for them again… why?"

"Mercy's not about earning it, Kael," Gond said, helping him sit up. "It's a gift. Now it's up to you to figure out how to be worthy of it."

Kael stared at his healed side, then up at Gond, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. "So… now what?"

"Now you choose," Gond said, getting to his feet. "Go back to selling your sword… or find a different way."

"What different way? This is all I got."

"Then learn something new." Gond gestured to the city, where the newly freed were starting to move, to hope. "Folks here need help. Real help. Temples to rebuild, lives to put back together. There's work, Kael, for men willing to serve something bigger than their own pockets."

Kael pushed himself up, testing his side. "You think a dog like me could do that?"

"I think any man can change, if he wants it enough." Gond met his gaze. "Question is, Kael, do you want it enough to do the work? To actually *be* different?"

He left Kael standing in the alley, alive and whole, staring at his hands as if seeing them for the first time. What the man would do with this second chance remained to be seen. But for the first time since their paths had crossed again, Gond felt something like hope for his former friend.

## The Spark of Rebellion

The victory at Saltmere sent ripples along the coast. After a week of rest, resupply, and the establishment of a provisional council under Sim's spiritual guidance, Gond's army marched on Blackwater. The city was smaller than Saltmere, but its reputation for cruelty was just as dark.

The siege of Blackwater began much like Saltmere's, with Grimjaw's engines pounding the walls. But Maera's network had been busy. Whispers of Saltmere's fall, of slaves freed and a benevolent goddess returning, had found fertile ground within Blackwater's oppressed populace. On the third night of the siege, as Gond's forces prepared for another tunnel assault, the city itself erupted.

Fires bloomed in the merchant district like deadly flowers. Shouts and the clash of makeshift weapons echoed from within—kitchen knives against guard swords, cobblestones hurled from rooftops, chains broken and turned into flails. A significant portion of the city guard, long resentful of the Gorlatch cultists' iron grip and perhaps swayed by Maera's agents, turned on their masters. The rebellion was chaotic, desperate, but it threw Blackwater's defenses into disarray.

"Now!" Gond yelled, his voice cutting through the chaos. "Alanyi's with the bold! Go!"

The assault was swift. With defenders fighting on two fronts, the walls were breached with surprising ease. Gond's army poured into a city already tearing itself apart. They linked up with rebel factions, guiding the chaotic energy towards the inner keep, the black heart of Blackwater where the slaver lords and Gorlatch's priests made their stand.

The keep was a fortress of despair. Its dungeons, when finally breached, revealed horrors that chilled even the most hardened veterans. A hidden temple to Gorlatch lay in the dungeons beneath, its altar stained with ancient blood, its cells filled with the remains of countless victims of torture and sacrifice. The air itself felt poisoned by suffering.

Sir Marcus Brightwater, witnessing the depths of the depravity his former order had tacitly supported, sank to his knees, his face ashen. "May Turin forgive us," he choked out. "May Alanyi cleanse us."

Gond, his expression grim, placed a hand on the knight's shoulder. "They will, if our actions now prove worthy." The capture of Blackwater was a victory, but the discovery within its keep was a stark reminder of the true enemy's nature.

## The Light of Divine Confrontation

Port Sorrow was the last of the three great slaver cities on Slaver's Coast. As Gond's army approached, an eerie stillness hung over it. Scouts reported that most of the regular soldiers had fled, deserting their posts. Yet, the city was not undefended. Three ominous black-sailed ships lay anchored in its harbor, and the ramparts were manned by figures in dark robes—Gorlatch's elite clerics.

As the army arrayed itself for the assault, a wave of pure terror washed over them. It was not the fear of battle, but a supernatural dread, far more potent than any they had faced before. Soldiers screamed, dropping weapons, their courage dissolving like mist. Horses reared, throwing their riders. Even seasoned warriors like Elena and Pell faltered, their faces pale with an unseen horror.

Gond felt the icy tendrils of fear attempt to grip his own heart, but Alanyi's fire burned within him, a defiant inferno. He saw his army, his people, on the verge of collapse. He knew what he had to do.

He strode to the front lines, his sword held high. "Alanyi!" he roared, his voice a challenge to the encroaching darkness. Raising his sword, he sent its light into the sky.

The effect was instantaneous and overwhelming. A column of incandescent white light erupted from his sword, soaring into the sky before exploding outwards, bathing Port Sorrow and the surrounding lands in a blinding, purifying radiance. The oppressive fear shattered like glass struck by a hammer. The shadows receded like living things fleeing from flame. Courage, warm and fierce, flooded back into the hearts of his soldiers—shoulders straightened, weapons were retrieved with steady hands, and battle cries replaced screams of terror. The three black ships in the harbor smoldered, then caught fire, their unholy timbers consumed by the divine light.

The effort was immense. Gond felt his life force drain as if an ocean were emptying through him. His knees buckled, his vision blurred to gray at the edges, and then he collapsed, the world dissolving into blackness.

When he awoke, it was to Sim's anxious face and Silviana's cool hand on his brow. The sounds of battle still raged, but they were distant.

"The city…?" Gond managed, his throat raw.

"Your light broke their power, Gond," Silviana said, her voice a quiet balm. "The army's fighting with new heart. But their strongest priests… they've taken refuge in Gorlatch's main temple. Shielded by shadow. No one can get near."

Gond pushed himself up, every muscle screaming, but his eyes were clear. "Then I go."

Supported by Sim and Elena, he made his way to the heart of Port Sorrow. The temple of Gorlatch was a blasphemous edifice of black stone, pulsating with a visible aura of dark energy. Before it, his army waited, unable to breach the shimmering wall of shadow.

Gond stepped forward alone. "Servants of the Chained God!" His voice was thin, but it cracked with an authority that wasn't entirely his own. "Your master's time is up!"

The barrier shimmered, and a figure oozed out—the High Priest of Gorlatch, eyes like burning coals, power crackling around him like dark lightning. "Foolish whelp. You play with powers you can't even imagine."

"And I wield a power you've long forgotten," Gond shot back, finding a spark of strength. "Hope. Mercy. Today you'll learn that these are stronger than hate."

The battle that followed was not of steel, but of spirit. The High Priest, a conduit for Gorlatch's malevolent will, unleashed blasts of shadow, whispers of despair, illusions of torment. Gond, drawing upon his last reserves, channeled Alanyi's grace. He met the High Priess' unholy magic with shields of light, affirmations of faith, and the unwavering conviction of a soul dedicated to healing.

Darkness surged, threatening to overwhelm, but Alanyi's light, though sometimes flickering, refused to be extinguished. Gond felt her presence, her sorrow for a world so wounded, her fierce love for her children. He became more than Gond; he became her sword, her shield, her unwavering heart. Despite his exhaustion, Gond felt a renewed strength as Alanyi's power restored him.

With a final, desperate surge, the High Priest channeled Gorlatch's essence. A colossal shadow of the Chained God loomed over the temple, its ethereal chains rattling. But Gond met it with an equally potent manifestation of Alanyi—a radiant figure of light and compassion, whose gentle strength seemed to dissolve the very chains of the shadow.

The High Priest screamed as the divine energies collided, his form consumed first by shadow, then by a cleansing fire. The dark temple shuddered, its black stones cracking, and then, with a sound like a dying god's sigh, it imploded, collapsing into a ruin from which pure, white light emanated.

Gond stood, swaying but triumphant, Alanyi's light fading gently around him. Port Sorrow was free.

## March to Aid the Dwarves

The coastal campaign was over. Saltmere, Blackwater, Port Sorrow were all cleansed, their slave pens emptied, their dark temples shattered. Gond, recovering slowly from the divine duel, oversaw the initial stages of restoration, Sim and Silviana working tirelessly to establish Alanyi's worship and heal the deep scars left by Gorlatch's reign.

Weeks passed. The army, though weary, was buoyed by its victories. Then, a dust-caked dwarven messenger arrived, bearing an urgent dispatch from Thorek Ironheart.

"High Paladin," the dwarf announced, his voice hoarse with fatigue and the strain of hard riding. "Thorek sends greetings and a plea. We have besieged the Citadel of Asham-Val, the last great stronghold of the corrupt Order of Turin in the Gray Peaks. Their defenses are formidable, their resolve hardened by desperation. We have them contained, but breaking their walls proves… costly. The King requests your aid, that our victory might be swift and the suffering lessened."

Gond listened, his gaze distant. The Citadel of Asham-Val. He knew its reputation—a fortress deemed impregnable, the heart of the human faction that still clung to the old ways of oppression, that had profited from the slave trade and resisted Alanyi's return.

His own army was tired. He was tired. But the war was not yet won. The dwarves, their staunchest allies, had called for aid.

He looked at Elena, at Sir Marcus, at Pell and Maera. Their expressions mirrored his own understanding.

"Get the captains," Gond said, his voice finding its old steel. "Tell the army. We move at dawn." He looked at the dwarven messenger, a weary but determined smile touching his lips. "Tell Thorek the Cleansing Tide's rolling inland. We're on our way."
