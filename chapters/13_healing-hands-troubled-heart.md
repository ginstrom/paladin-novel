# Chapter 13: Healing Hands, Troubled Heart

The morning sun filtered through the valley's canopy, casting dappled shadows across the clearing where Gond sat cross-legged on a flat stone. His hands rested palm-up on his knees, fingers slightly curled as Silviana had shown him. The position felt ridiculous—like a street performer waiting for coins. His left foot had gone numb twenty minutes ago, and a persistent ache was building between his shoulder blades from holding his spine so rigidly straight.

"Breathe," Silviana said from her place on the moss-covered log beside him. "Feel the light within you, not as a foreign thing, but as part of your very essence."

Gond's jaw tightened. "I feel like an idiot."

"That is progress." Her voice carried the hint of a smile. "Yesterday you felt like a fraud."

Three weeks had passed since the elven lore-keeper's arrival. Three weeks of what she called "divine education" and what he called "sitting around pretending to be mystical." The settlement had grown accustomed to seeing them together each dawn—the gruff former mercenary and the ageless elf, an unlikely pair of teacher and student.

"Close your eyes," Silviana instructed. "Reach for the warmth you felt when you healed Dax."

Gond obeyed, though his shoulders remained rigid. The memory came easily enough—the desperate pull in his chest, the sensation of something flowing out of him and into the dying young man. But trying to summon that feeling deliberately was like grasping smoke.

"I can't—" he began.

"You are trying to command it," Silviana interrupted. "Divine power is not a sword to be wielded. It is a river to be channeled."

"Rivers can be dammed."

"And what happens to a river when it is dammed?"

Gond opened his eyes to find her watching him with those ancient, knowing eyes. "It finds another way through. Or it builds pressure until it breaks free."

"Precisely." She gestured toward the settlement below, where smoke rose from cooking fires and the sounds of daily life drifted upward. "Your power has been finding its own way through—in moments of crisis, when your conscious mind steps aside."

The strain. Gond's hand moved unconsciously to his chest, where a persistent ache had settled after each healing. Not pain exactly, but a tension, as if he were forcing divine energy through channels too narrow to contain it properly. After healing Dax, he'd slept for nearly two days. The smaller healings since—a child's fever, an infected wound, a broken bone—left him exhausted for hours.

"The exhaustion will lessen," Silviana said, reading his thoughts with unsettling accuracy. "As you learn to open yourself properly to the divine flow rather than fighting against it."

A commotion from below interrupted their session. Voices raised in argument, the sound of running feet. Gond was on his feet before he'd consciously decided to move. His hand reached for the sword that wasn't there—he'd left his weapons in his hut, as Silviana insisted during their morning sessions.

"Gond!" Pell's voice carried up the slope, sharp with urgency. "We need you!"

The thief appeared through the trees, his usually composed face tight with worry. Behind him came Sim, supporting a woman Gond didn't recognize—middle-aged, her clothes torn and bloodied, her left arm hanging at an unnatural angle.

"Found her at the valley's edge," Pell said without preamble. "Says she's been walking for days, following rumors of a healer."

The woman raised her head. Gond saw the desperation in her eyes—the same look he'd seen in every refugee who'd found their way here. But this was different. Worse. Her skin had a grayish pallor. When she tried to speak, blood flecked her lips.

"Internal injuries," Sim said quietly. "Beyond my skills."

Heat bloomed beneath Gond's ribs, spreading outward like spilled wine through fabric. His fingertips tingled with an electric warmth that made his hands tremble slightly. But this time, instead of letting it flow unchecked, he tried to apply Silviana's teachings. He closed his eyes briefly, reaching for that sense of channeling rather than commanding.

"Bring her to the healing circle," he said, his voice steadier than he felt.

They'd established the healing circle at Silviana's suggestion—a ring of smooth stones in a grove where the light fell just so, where the very air seemed to hum with potential. As they laid the woman on the soft grass within the circle, Gond knelt beside her and placed his hands gently on her shoulders.

"What's your name?" he asked.

"Mira," she whispered. "My… my village. They came in the night. Slavers. I hid in the root cellar, but when I tried to help the others…" She coughed, more blood staining her lips.

Gond felt the rage building—the old, familiar fury at the injustice of it all. But beneath that anger, something else stirred. The divine light, responding not to his commands but to his compassion. He let himself feel Mira's pain, her terror, her desperate hope.

The power flowed through him like warm honey, slower and more controlled than before. He felt it seeking out the damaged places within her—the internal bleeding, the shattered ribs, the trauma that went deeper than flesh. Through his palms, he sensed torn vessels sealing themselves, felt the grinding sensation of bone fragments drawing together and fusing. Her labored breathing eased as punctured lung tissue mended, and the gray pallor of her skin gradually warmed to healthy pink. But as the healing progressed, Gond became aware of something else: the effort of proper channeling.

The world blazed white around him. That same overwhelming pulse of divine essence he'd felt with Dax, but more focused now. More controlled. The connection formed between divine will and mortal need, a bridge of golden light that let him channel Alanyi's grace into her broken body. Each mended bone required deeper concentration. Each sealed wound demanded greater spiritual focus.

The divine power flowed endlessly from its source—but his capacity to channel it had limits. The realization should have frightened him, but instead it brought clarity. This was the true challenge of his calling: not just the responsibility of choice, but learning to be a worthy vessel for divine grace.

When the healing was complete, Mira sat up slowly, her color restored, her breathing clear. She stared at her mended arm in wonder, flexing fingers that had been broken moments before.

"How?" she breathed.

Gond swayed slightly as he stood. Silviana's steadying hand touched his elbow. "Rest here tonight," he told Mira. "Sim will see that you're fed and given clean clothes. Tomorrow, if you choose to stay, we'll find you a place among us."

As they helped Mira to one of the guest shelters, Gond caught Silviana's eye. The elf nodded approvingly, but her expression remained serious.

"You felt it," she said once they were alone again. "The true effort."

"The strain," Gond said, settling heavily onto a fallen log. "The healing you showed me demands more focus, more spiritual discipline."

"Precisely," Silviana corrected. "The divine power does not diminish—it flows endlessly from its source. But your capacity to channel it safely grows only through practice and spiritual development."

Gond considered this as he watched the settlement below. More people had arrived in recent days—word of the "healer in the hills" spreading despite their efforts at secrecy. Each new face brought hope and desperation in equal measure. Each represented another choice, another burden.

"What if I lack the strength to channel the power? I don't know if I could repeat that healing if another injured person appeared now."

"Alanyi will never ask you to give more than you can," said Silviana.

Gond thought that could be taken in more than one way, but said nothing.

But even as Silviana spoke, Gond knew he wouldn't refuse. Couldn't refuse. Not when faces like Mira's looked to him with such desperate hope. The choice had been made the moment he'd first felt the divine light stir within him—perhaps even before that, in the slave ship's hold when he'd chosen to help others escape rather than flee alone.

"The exhaustion will pass," Silviana continued. "Your body will adapt, learn to channel the power more efficiently. But the weight of choice—that will remain."

As if summoned by her words, another commotion arose from the settlement's edge. More voices, more urgent calls for the healer. Gond closed his eyes and felt the divine power stirring again, ready to answer the call.

"How do you bear it?" he asked. "Knowing that every choice to heal one person might mean being too weak to heal the next?"

Silviana was quiet for a long moment, her gaze distant. "You learn to trust," she said finally. "Trust that the divine light knows its own purpose, even when you cannot see it. Trust that each healing, each choice, serves a greater pattern."

Another call echoed up from below—Pell's voice again, urgent but not panicked. Gond pushed himself to his feet, his legs unsteady beneath him. His hands shook slightly as he brushed dirt from his knees, and he had to pause a moment to let a wave of dizziness pass. The ache in his chest had deepened, but beneath it, he felt something else: a strange sense of rightness, as if he were finally walking a path meant for him.

"Come," Silviana said, rising gracefully beside him. "Let us see what new challenge awaits."

As they made their way down the slope, Gond reflected on the morning's lesson. He was beginning to understand that divine power wasn't something he possessed—it was something that possessed him, flowed through him, changed him with each use. The thought should have terrified him, but instead it brought an odd sort of peace.

He was no longer the man who'd awakened in chains, driven by thoughts of revenge. That man had died somewhere between the slave ship and this valley, replaced by someone he was still learning to recognize. Someone who chose to heal rather than harm, to protect rather than pursue vengeance.

The irony wasn't lost on him. In losing his old self, he'd found something far more valuable—a purpose that went beyond personal satisfaction or gain. It was a burden, yes, but it was also a gift.

The afternoon brought three more refugees: a family fleeing burned farmlands, their youngest child burning with fever. Gond healed the boy, then spent an hour teaching the parents how to recognize the signs of infection. By evening, Gond was so exhausted from channeling that he felt hollow inside. Still, the child's laughter as he played with the other settlement children made the cost seem worthwhile.

As darkness fell and the settlement settled into its nightly routines, Gond found himself sitting by the central fire, staring into the flames. Silviana approached with two cups of the herbal tea she favored—something that tasted of mint and sage.

"The hardest lesson," she said, settling beside him, "is learning when not to heal."

Gond accepted the cup gratefully, letting its warmth seep into his hands. "Meaning?"

"A paladin's capacity to channel divine power has limits, even as the power itself flows endlessly. Exhaust yourself on minor ailments, and you may lack the spiritual strength when true crisis strikes. The power to heal is also affected by the strength of the conduit-your own power as a paladin, but the patient's connection to Alanyi also anchors the connection, helps the power flow. You must take all of this into account when deciding who to heal."

The weight of her words settled over him like a heavy cloak. "So I'm supposed to choose who deserves healing and who doesn't?"

"You are supposed to choose wisely. To see the larger pattern, the greater need." Silviana sipped her tea, her expression thoughtful. "Sometimes Alanyi herself may guide your choices—instructing you to heal fully, or merely to ease suffering. Above all else, you must strive to obey the will of Alanyi when you would channel her divine power."

"And how am I supposed to know the will of Alanyi? I've never heard her voice since that first time in the temple."

"Trust me," said Silviana with a smile. "When the goddess speaks to you, you'll know it."

Gond drank his tea in silence, watching the flames dance and shift. Around them, the settlement hummed with quiet activity—families sharing evening meals, guards taking their posts, the soft murmur of conversation and laughter. All of it made possible by his choice to heal rather than flee, to build rather than destroy.

"The boy today," he said finally. "His fever—it wasn't life-threatening, was it?"

"Probably not. Sim's herbs would have broken it in a day or two."

"But his parents' faces when I healed him instantly…"

"Hope," Silviana finished. "You gave them hope. And hope, properly nurtured, can be more powerful than any sword."

Gond nodded slowly, beginning to understand. Each healing was more than just the mending of flesh—it was a statement, a promise, a beacon for others to follow. The divine power flowing through him wasn't just about individual miracles, but about building something larger.

The thought should have daunted him, but instead it filled him with a strange sense of anticipation. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new choices, new opportunities to channel the divine light in service of something greater than himself.
