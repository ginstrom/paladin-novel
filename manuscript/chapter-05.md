# The Reluctant Paladin

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 5 – A Change of Course

The pre-dawn mist curled thick and ghostly around Darach’s northern gate as Gond gently nudged Ash forward. His breath fogged in the chilly air as he adjusted his hood, hiding the mark that branded him an escaped slave. The city loomed ahead, imposing walls silhouetted against the pale dawn sky. Gond could feel his pulse quickening, every beat echoing with urgency.

Two sleepy guards lounged by the portcullis, leaning on their halberds. Their eyes sharpened as Gond approached.

“Hold there,” one guard growled, stepping forward, the lantern’s flame casting flickering shadows across his battle-scarred face. “Your name and your business?”

“Rosan Vale,” Gond lied smoothly, adopting the weary tone of a man burdened by travel. “Horse trader from Cliffmere. Storm scattered my stock; only Ash here remains.” He patted the cart-horse’s strong neck gently.

The second guard narrowed his eyes suspiciously and circled slowly, inspecting Ash’s rough harness and Gond's concealed sword. “A lone horse doesn't seem much of a trade.”

Gond forced a weary smile, sliding two silver coins into the guard's open palm. “It's all I could salvage. Gate fees, yes?”

The coins vanished swiftly, suspicion easing just a fraction. But as they stepped aside to let Gond through, the lantern swung too near, illuminating the edge of Gond’s brand. The older guard squinted sharply, recognition flickering across his eyes—then, miraculously, he said nothing.

Heart hammering, Gond urged Ash forward, spine stiff with apprehension as he passed beneath the heavy iron gate and into Darach.

### Gazes and Ghosts

Inside the city walls, Darach stirred to life, the air quickly filling with sounds of hawkers calling their wares and carts rumbling over cobblestones. But Gond felt eyes everywhere, whispers trailing him like ghosts. He tugged his cloak tighter around himself, paranoia prickling at his neck.

His fears solidified at the market square. A wanted poster fluttered in the breeze, a rough sketch of a face—his face—with the manacle brand unmistakably clear. His stomach churned as he read: **WANTED ALIVE – 500 ROYALS**. The bounty had doubled. Gond saw curious eyes turning toward him and knew he was moments away from discovery.

With practiced calm, he turned swiftly back toward the gate. The younger guard glanced up in surprise, but Gond’s curt nod and purposeful stride carried him back through without question. Outside, fresh air rushed into his lungs, easing his panic. He didn't slow until Darach had faded behind him, nothing more than a smudge on the horizon.

### Roadside Rescue

The northern road twisted quietly along the cliffside, bordered by wild heather and tangled shrubs. Gond’s alert eyes caught movement—a small figure struggling through mud, chains dragging at her feet. He quickly dismounted, hand cautiously raised in peace.

The young woman froze, terror stark in her wide eyes.

“I won't harm you,” Gond promised softly, showing empty palms. “I've been in your chains.”

She hesitated, visibly trembling, before exhaustion and relief overwhelmed her. “Lira,” she whispered. “I escaped this morning. They'll find me soon.”

“They won’t,” Gond said firmly, pulling a small metal file from his pack. Kneeling swiftly, he removed her shackles. The chains fell away with a heavy thud, Lira choking back tears of relief.

“Can you ride?” Gond asked.

Lira nodded gratefully, allowing him to lift her gently onto Ash’s sturdy back, her raw ankles wrapped carefully in cloth. Side by side, they hurried northward.

### Counsel at the Way-Station

Nightfall found the hidden way-station warm with firelight, the aroma of simmering stew greeting them. Sim, the gentle priest of Alanyi, rose in surprise, eyes filled with compassion as he welcomed Lira. Pell, their rogue companion, watched warily, tension melting only slightly as Gond explained the situation.

“Darach is death,” Gond concluded gravely. “We need to disappear.”

“Into thin air?” Pell scoffed, skepticism clear.

“Into the hills,” Gond corrected, pointing to Maera’s detailed map. “Few slavers venture there. Too rugged, too remote. We'll hide, rest, and figure out our next move.”

Sim nodded thoughtfully, eyes calm but resolved. “A wise choice. Safety first, and then we can consider what comes next.”

Aerin and Dax, watching intently, nodded agreement. Gond felt a powerful surge of responsibility, determination hardening in his chest.

“Then we leave at dawn,” Gond said decisively, his voice strong and confident. “A new start, a safe haven.”

Pell smiled grimly, anticipation glittering in his eyes. “Let's hope quiet and hidden stays quiet and hidden.”

### Dawn Departure

Morning broke clear and bright, bathing their small band in hopeful light. Gond led the way with Lira behind him, arms securely around the bedroll. Dax, his injured feet wrapped gently, dozed atop their second horse.

Ascending steadily, they left the coast behind, the rugged hills opening up ahead—untamed, mysterious, and promising sanctuary. Gond’s heart lifted cautiously. Revenge would come, but first came survival and safety.

He met Sim’s reassuring gaze, nodding silently in understanding. One day, justice—but today, they needed a home.
