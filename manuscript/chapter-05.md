# Paladin's Rise

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 5 – A Change of Course

Pre-dawn mist coiled around Blackwater's northern gate like ghostly fingers as Gond nudged Ash forward. His breath fogged in the chill air. He tugged his hood lower, hiding the brand that marked him as escaped property. The city's walls loomed ahead, black silhouettes against the pale sky. His pulse hammered against his throat.

Three guards clustered by the portcullis, halberds gleaming in the lantern light. Their eyes sharpened as Gond approached. The oldest stepped forward, scarred face hard as granite.

"Hold there." The guard's voice carried the authority of a man who'd killed for less. "Name and business?"

"Rosan Vale." Gond adopted the weary slouch of a man beaten down by travel. "Horse trader from Cliffmere. Storm scattered my stock—only Ash here survived." He patted the cart-horse's neck.

The second guard circled slowly, eyes taking in every detail. "One horse doesn't make much of a trade. Papers?"

Gond's stomach clenched. "Lost in the storm, along with everything else." He slid three silver coins into the guard's palm—more than the usual gate fee. "It's what the storm left me."

The coins vanished, but suspicion remained etched in weathered faces. The third guard stepped closer, lantern raised. Light caught the edge of Gond's brand before he could turn away.

"That's a fresh mark." The guard's hand drifted to his sword hilt. "Mighty fresh for a horse trader."

"Accident with a branding iron." Gond kept his voice steady. "Clumsy apprentice. You know how it is."

The guards exchanged glances. The oldest nodded slowly. "Aye. Happens to the best of us." But his eyes never left Gond's face. "Welcome to Blackwater, trader. Mind the curfew—sunset to sunrise, no one moves without papers."

Gond's spine went rigid as he passed beneath the iron gate. Every step expected the shout of alarm that never came. Yet.

Inside Blackwater's walls, the city stirred to life. Hawkers called their wares. Cart wheels rumbled over cobblestones. The air filled with the scents of bread and horse dung. But Gond felt eyes everywhere—whispers trailing him like smoke, curious glances that lingered too long.

At the market square, his worst fears materialized. A wanted poster fluttered against a wooden post. The sketch was crude but unmistakable—his face, his brand, clear as daylight. **WANTED ALIVE – 500 ROYALS**. More than double the standard bounty for escaped slaves.

A merchant glanced from the poster to Gond's face. Recognition dawned in the man's eyes. His mouth opened to shout.

Gond stepped close, hand resting on his concealed dagger. "Wouldn't." His voice carried the promise of violence. "Bad for business."

The merchant's mouth snapped shut. He nodded frantically and hurried away. But Gond caught him whispering to another trader, pointing in his direction.

More heads turned. Whispers spread like ripples in a pond. A city guard pushed through the crowd, hand on his sword. Gond melted into an alley, heart pounding.

The narrow passage reeked of garbage and piss. He pressed against the wall, listening to boots on cobblestones. The guard's voice carried clearly: "...branded slave... five hundred royals... search every inn and stable..."

Gond cursed under his breath. The city was a trap, and it was closing fast. He needed to reach Ash and get out. But as he peered around the corner, his blood turned to ice.

Four guards surrounded his horse. One held Ash's reins while another examined the saddle. A third guard waved the wanted poster, comparing it to something in his hand.

"He's here somewhere," said a guard. "Spread out. Check every building."

Gond backed deeper into the alley. Ash was lost. There was no way to recover it. His jaw clenched. The animal had carried him faithfully, and now he'd led them both into a trap.

The alley opened onto a side street. Gond pulled his hood lower and joined the flow of morning traffic. But everywhere he looked, guards questioned merchants, checked faces against the poster. The net was tightening.

A shout erupted behind him. "There! By the baker's stall!"

Gond didn't look back. He pushed through the crowd, ignoring angry curses. Boots pounded after him. A crossbow bolt splintered wood inches from his head.

He ducked into another alley, then another. The maze of Blackwater's back streets offered temporary refuge, but he was trapped. The guards knew the city better than he did. They'd corner him eventually.

A wooden door stood ajar. Gond slipped inside, finding himself in a cooper's workshop. Barrels lined the walls. Wood shavings covered the floor. The craftsman looked up in surprise.

"Shop's closed," the cooper said. "Come back—"

"Please." Gond showed empty hands. "I need to hide. Just until dark."

The cooper's eyes narrowed. Then he glanced at the window, where guards ran past shouting orders. Understanding flickered across his face. "Escaped slave?"

Gond nodded.

The cooper studied him for a long moment. Then he pointed to a large barrel in the corner. "That one's empty. But if they search here..."

"I know the risk." Gond moved to the corner. "Thank you."

The barrel reeked of old wine, but it concealed him completely. Through the wooden slats, he heard guards searching nearby buildings. Doors slammed. Now there was pounding on the cooper's door. Voices shouted questions. The cooper answered calmly, claiming he'd seen nothing.

Hours crawled by. Gond's legs cramped in the confined space. His back ached. But he forced himself to remain still, breathing shallowly. Outside, the search continued. Guards passed the workshop three times, but none entered.

As afternoon shadows lengthened, the activity gradually died down. The cooper tapped the barrel softly. "They've moved to the eastern quarter. But they've got men watching the gates."

Gond climbed out, muscles protesting. "The walls?"

"Thirty feet high. Smooth stone. But there's a section near the old temple of Alanyi where the mortar's crumbling." The cooper sketched directions on a wood shaving. "Wait for full dark. Guards change shifts at midnight."

"Why help me?"

The cooper rolled up his sleeve, revealing a faded brand. "Twenty years ago, that was me in the barrel."

Darkness fell like a shroud over Blackwater. Gond waited until the temple bells chimed midnight, then slipped from the workshop. The streets lay empty except for patrol guards with torches. He avoided their routes, keeping to shadows.

The old temple district squatted against the city's western wall. Crumbling buildings leaned against each other like drunken beggars. Weeds pushed through broken cobblestones. The air smelled of decay and abandonment.

Gond found the ruined temple the cooper had described. Above the half-fallen archway he could barely make out the intertwined circles of Alanyi. Ancient stones showed gaps where mortar had crumbled away. Handholds, if he was careful. And desperate.

He tested the first stone. It held his weight. The second shifted slightly but didn't fall. Inch by inch, he climbed. His fingers found cracks in the mortar. His boots scraped against stone. Every sound seemed loud as thunder in the night silence.

Halfway up, a stone shifted under his foot. Pebbles rattled down the wall. He froze, listening. Footsteps approached—a guard making his rounds. Torchlight flickered below.

Gond pressed against the wall, praying the shadows would hide him. The guard paused directly beneath, torch raised. Light played across the stones inches from Gond's boots.

"Probably just a cat," the guard muttered, and moved on.

Gond's arms trembled with strain. Sweat stung his eyes despite the cool night air. But he forced himself to continue climbing. The wall's top seemed impossibly distant.

His hand closed on the parapet. With a final surge of effort, he hauled himself over. The city spread below like a map of flickering lights. Beyond the walls, darkness promised freedom.

The outer face of the wall offered fewer handholds. Gond lowered himself carefully, testing each grip. His shoulders burned. His fingers cramped. But gradually, the ground drew closer.

He dropped the final ten feet, rolling to absorb the impact. Pain shot through his ankle, but nothing felt broken. He limped away from the wall, not stopping until Blackwater's lights faded behind him.

The northern road stretched ahead, empty and dark. Without Ash, the journey back to the waypoint would take most of the night. Gond set a steady pace, favoring his twisted ankle. Every shadow might hide pursuers. Every sound could signal danger.

Dawn was breaking when he spotted movement ahead—a small figure struggling through roadside mud, chains dragging at her feet. He approached carefully, hands visible and empty.

The young woman froze, terror stark in her wide eyes.

"I won't hurt you." Gond kept his voice soft. "I've worn those chains."

She trembled, exhaustion warring with hope in her gaunt features. "Lira," she whispered. "Escaped yesterday. They'll come for me."

"Not if I can help it." Gond pulled a metal file from his pack and knelt beside her. The shackles fell away with heavy thuds. Lira choked back a sob, rubbing her raw ankles.

"Can you walk?"

She nodded, though her legs shook with fatigue. Together, they limped toward the waypoint. Gond's ankle throbbed with each step, but he pushed the pain aside. The woman needed his strength.

The waystation appeared through morning mist like a blessed vision. Sim rose in surprise as they approached. Compassion flooded his features as he welcomed Lira. Pell watched from the shadows, tension easing only when Gond explained.

"Blackwater is death," Gond concluded, settling heavily beside the fire. "They've doubled our bounty. Guards are searching every building, questioning every merchant. And they have Ash."

Pell's eyebrow arched. "What? How?"

"Surrounded him before I could get back." Gond's jaw tightened. "Which means they know we're in the area. They'll expand the search."

"How long before they find us?" Aerin asked, unconsciously moving closer to her brother.

"Days, maybe less. Word travels fast when there's gold involved." Gond studied their faces in the firelight. "We need to disappear. Deep into the hills where horses can't follow."

"Into thin air?" Pell's voice carried forced lightness.

"Into the wilderness." Gond recalled Maera's map. "Too rugged for slavers. Too remote for bounty hunters. We hide, rest, plan our next move."

Sim nodded, that calm certainty settling over him. "Wisdom. Safety first."

Dax flexed his healing hands. "I worked with my father's carpentry crew before..." He gestured at his branded wrist. "I know how to build, if we can find the materials. But we'll need tools. Axes for felling trees. Saws for cutting lumber."

"One problem at a time," Gond said. "First we survive. Then we build."

He looked around the circle of faces—frightened, hopeful, trusting. Something shifted in his chest. The weight of responsibility settled there, heavy but not unwelcome. These people depended on him. Their safety mattered more than his personal vengeance.

"Dawn, then." His voice carried new authority. "We take the remaining horse and disappear."

Pell's grin held anticipation and wariness in equal measure. "Let's hope hidden stays hidden."

Morning broke clear and bright, painting their small band in golden light. Gond helped Lira onto their remaining horse, her arms wrapped around the supply pack. Dax walked beside them, his injured feet healing but still tender.

They climbed steadily away from the coast, leaving the dangerous lowlands behind. The rugged hills opened before them—wild, untamed, promising sanctuary. Gond's shoulders straightened as they walked. The weight in his chest transformed into something that might have been hope.

He caught Sim's eye and nodded. The priest smiled back. Understanding passed between them without words.

Revenge could wait. Today, they needed a home.
