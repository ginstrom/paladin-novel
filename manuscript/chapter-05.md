# Paladin's Rise

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 5 – A Change of Course

Pre-dawn mist coiled around Blackwater's northern gate like ghostly fingers as Gond nudged Ash forward. His breath fogged in the chill air. He tugged his hood lower, hiding the brand that marked him as escaped property. The city's walls loomed ahead, black silhouettes against the pale sky. His pulse hammered against his throat.

Three guards clustered by the portcullis, halberds gleaming in the lantern light. Their eyes sharpened as Gond approached. The oldest stepped forward, scarred face hard as granite.

"Hold there." The guard's voice carried the authority of a man who'd killed for less. "Name and business?"

"Rosan Vale." Gond adopted the weary slouch of a man beaten down by travel. "Horse trader from Cliffmere. Storm scattered my stock—only Ash here survived." He patted the cart-horse's neck.

The second guard circled slowly, eyes taking in every detail. "One horse doesn't make much of a trade. Papers?"

Gond's stomach clenched. "Lost in the storm, along with everything else." He slid three silver coins into the guard's palm—more than the usual gate fee. "It's what the storm left me."

The coins vanished, but suspicion remained etched in weathered faces. The third guard stepped closer, lantern raised. Light caught the edge of Gond's brand before he could turn away.

"That's a fresh mark." The guard's hand drifted to his sword hilt. "Mighty fresh for a horse trader."

"Accident with a branding iron." Gond kept his voice steady. "Clumsy apprentice. You know how it is."

The guards exchanged glances. The oldest nodded slowly. "Aye. Happens to the best of us." But his eyes never left Gond's face. "Welcome to Blackwater, trader. Mind the curfew—sunset to sunrise, no one moves without papers."

Gond's spine went rigid as he passed beneath the iron gate. Every step expected the shout of alarm that never came. Yet.

Inside Blackwater's walls, the city stirred to life. Hawkers called their wares. Cart wheels rumbled over cobblestones. The air filled with the scents of bread and horse dung. But Gond felt eyes everywhere—whispers trailing him like smoke, curious glances that lingered too long.

At the market square, his worst fears materialized. A wanted poster fluttered against a wooden post. The sketch was crude but unmistakable—his face, his brand, clear as daylight. **WANTED ALIVE – 500 ROYALS**. More than double the standard bounty for escaped slaves.

A merchant glanced from the poster to Gond's face. The man's eyes widened, his pupils dilating as he took a sharp breath. His mouth opened to shout.

Gond stepped close, hand resting on his concealed dagger. "Wouldn't." His voice carried the promise of violence. "Bad for business."

The merchant's mouth snapped shut. He nodded frantically and hurried away. But Gond caught him whispering to another trader, pointing in his direction.

More heads turned. Whispers spread like ripples in a pond. A city guard pushed through the crowd, hand on his sword. Gond melted into an alley, heart pounding.

The narrow passage reeked of garbage and piss. He pressed against the wall, listening to boots on cobblestones. The guard's voice carried clearly: "...branded slave... five hundred royals... search every inn and stable..."

Gond cursed under his breath. The city was a trap, and it was closing fast. He needed to reach Ash and get out. But as he peered around the corner, his blood turned to ice.

Four guards surrounded his horse. One held Ash's reins while another examined the saddle. A third guard waved the wanted poster, comparing it to something in his hand.

"He's here somewhere," said a guard. "Spread out. Check every building."

Gond backed deeper into the alley. Ash was lost. There was no way to recover it. His jaw clenched. The animal had carried him faithfully, and now he'd led them both into a trap.

The alley opened onto a side street. Gond pulled his hood lower and joined the flow of morning traffic. But everywhere he looked, guards questioned merchants, checked faces against the poster. The net was tightening.

A shout erupted behind him. "There! By the baker's stall!"

Gond didn't look back. He pushed through the crowd, ignoring angry curses. Boots pounded after him. A crossbow bolt splintered wood inches from his head.

He ducked into another alley, then another. The maze of Blackwater's back streets offered temporary refuge, but he was trapped. The guards knew the city better than he did. They'd corner him eventually.

A wooden door stood ajar. Gond slipped inside, finding himself in a cooper's workshop. Barrels lined the walls. Wood shavings covered the floor. The craftsman looked up in surprise.

"Shop's closed," the man said. "Come back—"

"Please." Gond showed empty hands. "I need to hide. Just until dark."

The cooper's eyes narrowed. Then he glanced at the window, where guards ran past shouting orders. Understanding flickered across his face. "Escaped slave?"

Gond nodded.

The man studied him for a long moment. Then he pointed to a large barrel in the corner. "That one's empty. But if they search here..." He wiped his hands on his leather apron. "Name's Aldric, by the way. Figure if I'm risking my neck, we ought to know each other."

"I know the risk." Gond moved to the corner. "Thank you, Aldric."

The barrel reeked of old wine, but it concealed him completely. Through the wooden slats, he heard guards searching nearby buildings. Doors slammed. Now there was pounding on Aldric's door. Voices shouted questions. The cooper answered calmly, claiming he'd seen nothing.

Hours crawled by. Gond's legs cramped in the confined space. His back ached. But he forced himself to remain still, breathing shallowly. Outside, the search continued. Guards passed the workshop three times, but none entered.

As afternoon shadows lengthened, the activity gradually died down. The cooper tapped the barrel softly. "They've moved to the eastern quarter. But they've got men watching the gates."

Gond climbed out, muscles protesting. "The walls?"

"Thirty feet high. Smooth stone. But there's a section near the old temple of Alanyi where the mortar's crumbling." The cooper sketched directions on a wood shaving. "Wait for full dark. Guards change shifts at midnight."

"Why help me?"

The cooper rolled up his sleeve, revealing a faded brand. "Twenty years ago, that was me in the barrel."

Darkness fell like a shroud over Blackwater. Gond waited until the temple bells chimed midnight, then slipped from the workshop. The streets lay empty except for patrol guards with torches. He avoided their routes, keeping to shadows.

The old temple district squatted against the city's western wall. Crumbling buildings leaned against each other like drunken beggars. Weeds pushed through broken cobblestones. The air smelled of decay and abandonment.

Gond found the ruined temple the cooper had described. Above the half-fallen archway he could barely make out the intertwined circles of Alanyi. Ancient stones showed gaps where mortar had crumbled away. Handholds, if he was careful. And desperate.

He tested the first stone. It held his weight. The second shifted slightly but didn't fall. Inch by inch, he climbed. His fingers found cracks in the mortar. His boots scraped against stone. Every sound seemed loud as thunder in the night silence.

Halfway up, a stone shifted under his foot. Pebbles rattled down the wall. He froze, listening. Footsteps approached—a guard making his rounds. Torchlight flickered below.

Gond pressed against the wall, praying the shadows would hide him. The guard paused directly beneath, torch raised. Light played across the stones inches from Gond's boots.

"Probably just a cat," the guard muttered, and moved on.

The footsteps faded. Gond remained motionless, muscles screaming, until silence returned. A bead of sweat dripped down his nose, falling on the stones twenty feet below. He forced himself to continue climbing. His arms trembled with strain. His fingers cramped. But the wall's top drew closer with each desperate handhold.

Three-quarters of the way up, Blackwater's bells began to toll. The deep bronze notes rolled across the city like thunder. Alarm bells. They'd discovered his escape.

Below, torchlight flickered back toward the wall. The guard's voice carried clearly in the night air: "Search every shadow! He's here somewhere!"

The torch began moving back along the wall's base, growing brighter with each step.
