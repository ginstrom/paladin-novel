# Paladin's Rise

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 5 – A Change of Course

Pre-dawn mist coiled around Blackwater's northern gate like ghostly fingers as Gond nudged Ash forward. His breath fogged in the chill air. He tugged his hood lower, hiding the brand that marked him as escaped property. The city's walls loomed ahead, black silhouettes against the pale sky. His pulse hammered against his throat.

Two guards lounged by the portcullis, halberds propped against their shoulders. Their eyes sharpened as Gond approached. Lantern light danced across battle-scarred faces.

"Hold there." The older guard stepped forward, flame casting flickering shadows. "Name and business?"

"Rosan Vale." Gond adopted the weary slouch of a man beaten down by travel. "Horse trader from Cliffmere. Storm scattered my stock—only Ash here survived." He patted the cart-horse's neck.

The second guard circled slowly. His eyes took in Ash's rough harness and Gond's concealed sword. "One horse doesn't make much of a trade."

Gond forced his lips into a tired smile. He slid two silver coins into the guard's palm. "It's what the storm left me. Gate fees?"

The coins vanished. Suspicion eased from the guards' faces. But as they stepped aside, the lantern swung too close. Light caught the edge of Gond's brand. The older guard's eyes narrowed. Recognition flickered across his weathered features.

Then, inexplicably, he said nothing.

Gond's spine went rigid as he passed beneath the iron gate. Every step expected the shout of alarm that never came.

Inside Blackwater's walls, the city stirred to life. Hawkers called their wares. Cart wheels rumbled over cobblestones. The air filled with the scents of bread and horse dung. But Gond felt eyes everywhere—whispers trailing him like smoke, curious glances that lingered too long.

At the market square, his worst fears materialized. A wanted poster fluttered against a wooden post. The sketch was crude but unmistakable—his face, his brand, clear as daylight. **WANTED ALIVE – 500 ROYALS**. It was double the normal bounty for an escaped slave.

A merchant glanced from the poster to Gond's face, eyes widening. Gond turned and walked away, forcing himself not to run. More heads turned. Whispers followed.

He made it to the gate before the shouts began.

"You there! Stop!"

Gond didn't look back. The younger guard glanced up in surprise as he passed. But Gond's purposeful stride and curt nod carried him through without question. Only when Blackwater had shrunk to a smudge on the horizon did he allow himself to breathe freely.

The northern road twisted along cliffsides bordered by wild heather and gorse. Gond's eyes caught movement ahead—a small figure struggling through roadside mud, chains dragging at her feet. He dismounted, hands raised and empty.

The young woman froze, terror stark in her wide eyes.

"I won't hurt you." Gond kept his voice soft, showing his palms. "I've worn those chains."

She trembled, exhaustion warring with hope in her gaunt features. "Lira," she whispered. "Escaped this morning. They'll come for me."

"No, they won't." Gond pulled a metal file from his pack and knelt beside her. The shackles fell away with heavy thuds. Lira choked back a sob, rubbing her raw ankles.

"Can you ride?"

She nodded. He lifted her onto Ash's broad back. Her weight settled against the bedroll, arms wrapping around it for support. Together, they turned north toward safety.

Nightfall found the way-station warm with firelight and the rich aroma of stew. Sim rose in surprise. Compassion flooded his features as he welcomed Lira. Pell watched from the shadows, tension easing only when Gond explained.

"Blackwater is death," Gond concluded. "We need to disappear."

"Into thin air?" Pell's eyebrow arched.

"Into the hills." Gond recalled Maera's map. "Too rugged for slavers. Too remote for bounty hunters. We hide, rest, plan our next move."

Sim nodded, that calm certainty settling over him. "Wisdom. Safety first."

Aerin and Dax exchanged glances, then nodded agreement. Gond felt something shift in his chest—a weight settling there, heavy but not unwelcome.

"Dawn, then." His voice carried new authority. "A fresh start."

Pell's grin held anticipation and wariness in equal measure. "Let's hope hidden stays hidden."

Morning broke clear and bright, painting their small band in golden light. Gond led the way with Lira secure behind him, her arms around the bedroll. Dax dozed atop their second horse, his injured feet wrapped and healing.

They climbed steadily away from the coast, leaving the dangerous lowlands behind. The rugged hills opened before them—wild, untamed, promising sanctuary. Gond's shoulders straightened as they rode. The weight in his chest transformed into something that might have been hope.

He caught Sim's eye and nodded. The priest smiled back. Understanding passed between them without words.

Revenge could wait. Today, they needed a home.
