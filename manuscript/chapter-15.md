# Paladin's Rise

## Part III: An Unlikely Saint

### Chapter 15: The Network Revealed

The first sign that everything was about to change came with the morning mist—a column of riders approaching from the south, moving with the disciplined precision of a military unit. But these weren't slavers. The banners they carried bore symbols Gond didn't recognize, and at their head rode a figure he knew all too well.

"Maera," Pell said, lowering his spyglass. "But she's not alone."

Gond stood at the settlement's rebuilt watchtower, studying the approaching group. Twenty riders, all armed and armored, but their formation spoke of protection rather than attack. And at their center, unmistakable despite the distance, was the elderly healer who'd first set him on this path.

"How many?" Thorek asked, joining them on the platform. The dwarf had spent the past week integrating himself into the settlement's defenses, and his presence had already begun to transform their capabilities.

"Twenty mounted, maybe more following on foot," Pell reported. "Mixed group—some look like soldiers, others like civilians. And there's something else." He handed the spyglass to Gond. "Look at the rear guard."

Gond adjusted the focus and felt his breath catch. Bringing up the rear of the column was a sight that defied belief—a massive siege engine being pulled by a team of oxen, its bronze-reinforced frame gleaming in the morning sun. And beside it, directing its movement with the casual expertise of a master craftsman, was a dwarf even larger than Thorek.

"Grimjaw Ironforge," Thorek breathed, his voice filled with something between awe and disbelief. "What in Turin's name is he doing here?"

"You know him?" Gond asked.

"Know him? Lad, Grimjaw is the finest siege engineer in the known world. His engines have broken more fortress walls than any other dwarf alive." Thorek's expression was troubled. "But he serves the Crown of Ironhold. Has for thirty years. What would bring him here?"

They had their answer within the hour, as the column reached the settlement's edge and Maera dismounted with the fluid grace of someone half her age. But it was the woman beside her who commanded immediate attention—tall, regal, with the bearing of someone accustomed to command. Her armor was practical but well-made, and the sword at her side showed the wear of frequent use.

"Gond," Maera said, approaching with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "You've been busy since we last met."

"Maera." Gond clasped her hands in greeting, noting the calluses that hadn't been there before. "You look... different."

"War changes everyone," she replied simply. Then, turning to her companion, "Allow me to present Captain Elena Brightblade, formerly of the Royal Guard of Westmarch."

The woman stepped forward, her gaze assessing Gond with professional interest. "So you're the one they're calling the Healer in the Hills. You're younger than I expected."

"And you're farther from Westmarch than I'd expect a Royal Guard to be," Gond replied carefully.

Elena's smile was sharp as a blade. "Former Royal Guard. I resigned my commission when I learned what my king was really funding with his tax revenues." Her expression darkened. "Turns out the slave trade has more friends in high places than I'd realized."

Before Gond could respond, a commotion from the rear of the column drew their attention. The massive dwarf—Grimjaw, presumably—was directing the positioning of his siege engine with a stream of colorful curses that would have made a sailor blush. The machine itself was a work of art, its bronze fittings inscribed with runes that seemed to pulse with their own inner light.

"Grimjaw!" Thorek called out, striding toward his kinsman. "What brings you to this place?"

The larger dwarf looked up from his work, his face splitting into a grin that revealed teeth capped with gold. "Thorek Ironheart! Should have known you'd be mixed up in this madness." He gestured toward the siege engine. "As for what brings me here—let's just say I got tired of building weapons for people who use them on the innocent."

"You defected?" Thorek's voice was carefully neutral, but Gond caught the undercurrent of hope.

"Defected, resigned, told the Crown to stuff their gold where the sun don't shine—call it what you will." Grimjaw's expression grew serious. "But when word reached me that a paladin of Alanyi had risen, that the old alliance might be renewed... well, some things are more important than steady pay."

Gond felt the weight of expectation settling on his shoulders again, but this time it was different. These weren't desperate refugees seeking miracles—these were professionals, soldiers and leaders who'd made calculated decisions to join his cause.

"How many more are coming?" he asked Maera.

The elderly woman's smile was enigmatic. "That depends on how well this meeting goes. But first, there are things you need to understand about what you've started here."

She led them to the settlement's council area, where a crowd had gathered to witness the arrival of so many newcomers. As they settled around the central fire, Maera gestured for silence.

"For the past six months," she began, "I've been traveling. Not as a simple healer, but as a messenger, carrying word of what happened in this valley to those who might be interested in hearing it."

"What kind of people?" Pell asked, his thief's instincts clearly on alert.

"The kind who've been waiting for a sign that change is possible," Elena answered. "Soldiers who've grown sick of enforcing unjust laws. Merchants who've lost family to slavers. Nobles who remember when honor meant something more than profit."

Maera nodded. "The network has been growing for years—people connected by shared disgust at what our world has become. But we've lacked something crucial: a symbol, a leader, a cause that could unite us."

"And now?" Gond asked, though he suspected he already knew the answer.

"Now we have the Healer of the Hills," Maera said simply. "The paladin who stands against the slave trade, who offers hope to the hopeless and protection to the innocent. The man who proved that divine power still flows to those worthy of it."

Gond felt the familiar stirring of divine energy, responding to the faith and hope radiating from those around him. But beneath it was something else—a growing awareness of the scope of what was being offered to him.

"How many?" he asked quietly.

"In the immediate area? Perhaps two hundred fighters, scattered across a dozen groups." Elena's voice was matter-of-fact. "Across the continent? Thousands. Maybe tens of thousands, if the right call goes out."

The numbers were staggering. Gond had grown accustomed to thinking in terms of his settlement's population—a few hundred souls at most. The idea of commanding thousands was both exhilarating and terrifying.

"And what do they want in return?" Thorek asked pragmatically.

"Victory," Grimjaw said bluntly. "An end to the slave trade and the corruption that enables it. A chance to build something better than what we've got now."

"That's not a small request," Sim observed quietly.

"No," Maera agreed. "It's not. But then, small requests don't require paladins."

As the discussion continued, Gond found himself studying the faces around him. These weren't the desperate refugees who'd first sought him out, driven by immediate need and personal tragedy. These were professionals, people who'd made calculated decisions based on strategic thinking and long-term planning.

It was both humbling and intimidating.

"There's something else," Elena said, her voice cutting through the tactical discussions. "Intelligence we've gathered about your enemies' response to recent events."

The circle fell silent, all attention focused on the former Royal Guard.

"The attack by the Crimson Company wasn't an isolated incident," she continued. "It was a test—a probe to determine your capabilities and weaknesses. When Captain Voss failed to return, it sent a message to some very powerful people."

"What kind of message?" Gond asked.

"That you're a genuine threat. Not just to individual slaver operations, but to the entire system that enables them." Elena's expression was grim. "They're organizing a response. Multiple companies, coordinated attacks, political pressure on anyone who might support you."

"How long do we have?" Thorek asked.

"Weeks, maybe a month. But when they come, it won't be fifty slavers with crossbows. It'll be hundreds, possibly thousands, with siege equipment and magical support."

The weight of her words settled over the gathering like a physical presence. Gond felt the divine power stirring within him, responding to the threat against those under his protection. But he also felt something else—a clarity of purpose that cut through the fear and uncertainty.

The familiar pulse flickered through him, weaker than before but still unmistakable—that echo of blazing light from Dax's healing, from Mira's restoration. Each time he drew upon the divine power, the hollow space beneath his ribs seemed to expand slightly, as if something essential was being slowly carved away. The sensation lasted only a moment, but it left him with the growing awareness that his strength was not infinite.

"Then we don't wait for them to come to us," he said quietly.

"What do you mean?" Maera asked.

Gond stood, his gaze sweeping across the assembled faces. "I mean we stop reacting and start acting. We take the fight to them before they can organize their response."

"That's a significant escalation," Elena warned. "Once you start actively attacking slaver operations, there's no going back. You'll be committed to total war."

"We're already committed," Gond replied. "The moment I chose to heal instead of hide, the moment I decided to build something instead of just surviving—we were committed. The only question is whether we fight on our terms or theirs."

Grimjaw's laugh was like the rumble of distant thunder. "Now that's the kind of talk I like to hear! My engines have been idle too long."

"The Iron Covenant stands ready," Thorek added formally. "Our weapons, our warriors, our knowledge—all at your disposal."

"And the network?" Gond asked, looking at Maera.

The elderly woman's smile was fierce and proud. "The network has been waiting for this moment for years. Give the word, and you'll have more allies than you know what to do with."

Gond felt the weight of decision settling on his shoulders, but this time it didn't feel crushing. Instead, it felt like destiny—the culmination of everything that had brought him to this point.

"Then let's give them something to really worry about," he said.

***

The planning session that followed stretched late into the night, maps and intelligence reports spread across every available surface. What emerged was a picture of the slave trade that was both more extensive and more vulnerable than Gond had realized.

"The key is the coastal cities," Elena explained, pointing to a series of marks on the largest map. "Darach, Westport, Ironhaven—they're the major hubs where slaves are processed and shipped. Take out their operations, and you cripple the entire network."

"Easier said than done," Pell observed. "Those cities have walls, guards, political protection."

"Walls can be broken," Grimjaw said confidently. "Guards can be defeated. As for political protection..." He shrugged. "Hard to protect something that's been reduced to rubble."

"We're not talking about destroying cities," Gond said firmly. "We're talking about liberating them. There's a difference."

"Aye, there is," Thorek agreed. "But liberation sometimes requires force. The question is how much force, and how precisely applied."

As they debated tactics and strategies, Gond found himself thinking about the people who would be caught in the middle of whatever conflict was coming. The slaves who needed liberation, yes, but also the ordinary citizens who'd been living under the current system without necessarily supporting it.

"What about the people?" he asked. "The ones who aren't slavers or slaves, but just... people. Shopkeepers, craftsmen, farmers. What happens to them when we start tearing down the system they've been living under?"

The question brought a moment of silence to the planning session. It was Elena who finally answered.

"That's what separates a liberation from a conquest," she said quietly. "A conqueror doesn't care about the people caught in the middle. A liberator makes them part of the solution."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning we don't just tear down the old system—we help build the new one. We show people that there's a better way to live, a better way to organize society." She gestured toward the settlement around them. "You've already started doing that here. The question is whether you can do it on a larger scale."

Gond looked around at the faces gathered in the firelight—former soldiers and current refugees, dwarven engineers and elven lore-keepers, thieves and priests and healers. All of them united by a shared vision of something better than what they'd left behind.

"We can," he said with quiet certainty. "We will."

***

The interruption came just as the war council was breaking up—urgent voices from the settlement's edge, the sound of people in distress. Gond looked up from the maps to see Sim hurrying toward them, his face grave.

"Gond," the priest called out. "There's a family at the gates. Refugees from Millhaven. They've been traveling for days, and..." He paused, his expression pained. "The grandmother is dying."

Gond felt the familiar stirring of divine power, responding automatically to the call for healing. But beneath it was a resolve to follow the will of Alanyi that he had defied before.

"Show me," he said.

The family huddled near the settlement's entrance—a man and woman in their thirties, three children ranging from perhaps six to twelve, and an elderly woman who lay on a makeshift stretcher. Even from a distance, Gond could see the gray pallor of approaching death, the labored breathing that spoke of a body giving up its fight.

"This is Jorik and Mira," Sim said quietly as they approached. "Their children—Tam, Bess, and little Fen. And this is Jorik's mother, Grandmother Nessa."

The old woman's eyes fluttered open as Gond knelt beside her stretcher. Despite her condition, her gaze was clear and aware. "You're him," she whispered. "The healer. I told them... told them we had to reach you."

"Grandmother, save your strength," Jorik said, his voice thick with grief. "The healer is here now. He'll make you well."

But as Gond placed his hands on the old woman's chest, feeling for the familiar flow of divine power, he sensed something else—a gentle but unmistakable presence in his mind. Alanyi's voice, soft as a whisper but clear as crystal: *Her time has come, my son. Ease her pain, but do not hold her spirit to this world. She has served her purpose.*

Gond's hands trembled slightly. The instruction was clear, just as it had been with Willem. But this time, he remembered the cost of defiance—the tearing sensation, the lesson learned too late.

"I understand," he whispered, so quietly that only the goddess could hear.

Instead of the full healing power he might have channeled, Gond let only a gentle warmth flow through his hands. Not the blazing light that could mend bones and restore life, but a softer radiance that eased pain and brought peace. The old woman's labored breathing grew easier, the lines of suffering smoothing from her face.

"Better?" he asked gently.

Grandmother Nessa smiled, her eyes bright despite her failing body. "Much better. The pain is... gone." She turned her head toward her family. "Come close, all of you."

As the family gathered around her, the old woman spoke in a voice that was weak but clear. "I need you to understand something. I've been ready to go for weeks now. The sickness... it should have taken me before we ever left Millhaven."

"Grandmother, don't say that," young Bess whispered, tears streaming down her face.

"Hush, child. Listen." Nessa's gaze moved to each family member in turn. "I held on because you needed me to. Because you needed a reason to keep going, to make this journey. If I had died back home, you might have given up. Might have thought there was no point in seeking the healer."

Jorik's face crumpled. "We would have come anyway. For the children—"

"Would you?" Nessa asked gently. "Or would grief have made you think it was too dangerous, too uncertain? I know you, my son. You would have found reasons to stay, to accept what seemed inevitable." She reached out with a trembling hand to touch his cheek. "I stayed because you needed hope. And now... now you're here. You're safe. The children will grow up free."

Gond felt tears stinging his eyes as he watched the family's grief and understanding war across their faces.

"I'm ready now," the old woman said, her voice growing fainter. "Ready to meet Alanyi in the next world."

She closed her eyes, her breathing growing shallow. Within minutes, it stopped entirely, her face peaceful in the firelight.

The family wept, but it was the clean grief of acceptance rather than the bitter anguish of senseless loss. As they held each other, Gond stood slowly, feeling the weight of divine wisdom settling over him.

"You did the right thing," Sim said quietly, appearing at his side. "I saw what you did—the healing that eased her pain without prolonging her suffering. That took wisdom."

Gond nodded, thinking of Willem and the lesson learned through defiance. "Sometimes mercy means letting go," he said, echoing Silviana's words from that terrible day. "Sometimes the greatest healing is knowing when not to heal."

As the family began the process of preparing Grandmother Nessa for burial, Gond returned to the dying fire where Elena and Maera waited. The weight of what they were planning—what he was committing to—was enormous. But for the first time since accepting his calling, he felt truly ready for what lay ahead.

He had learned to trust divine wisdom even when his heart rebelled against it. He had learned that being a paladin meant serving a purpose larger than his own understanding. And he had learned that sometimes the greatest strength came not from standing alone, but from standing with others who shared your vision of what the world could become.
