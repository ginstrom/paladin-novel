# Paladin's Rise

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 4 – Crack in the Chain

Gulls wheeled overhead, their harsh cries cutting through the salt-heavy air. Gond, Pell, and Sim moved along the cliff-top path, their tattered clothes snapping in the stiff breeze. Blackwater still lay leagues ahead, but the prickle between Gond's shoulder blades warned that danger stalked closer.

Mid-morning, Pell dropped to a crouch beside flattened thicket. Gond joined him, studying the crushed grass and broken branches. Nearby, Sim examined trampled lavender stalks, his fingers tracing the damage.

"Five, maybe six." Gond's voice came out flat. "Slave-catchers."

Sim straightened, brushing dirt from his hands. "Fresh tracks. Less than an hour."

"On this narrow track there's no way to go around them," said Gond. "We'll follow behind at a distance and then steer around them on the flats."

"Fantastic." Pell adjusted the rope across his shoulder. "I was beginning to miss trouble."

The trail descended into rolling dunes where voices drifted upward on the wind. Gond raised his fist, and the others froze. Below, a narrow wagon creaked toward the coast road, drawn by two sturdy horses. Two slavers lounged on the driver's bench, relaxed as men counting easy coin. A third walked alongside, whip coiled at his belt like a sleeping snake.

Behind the wagon stumbled two young captives—a boy and girl, heavy chains dragging at their ankles. The girl's shoulders shook with silent sobs.

Gond's knuckles whitened around the boathook. They had little chance against seasoned slavers, but the alternative was watching more innocents dragged away in chains. "Stay sharp."

"Are you changing the plan?" hissed Pell. After a glance at Gond, Pell shrugged and unwound his rope.

Gond's jaw clenched so hard his teeth ached. His free hand curled into a fist, nails biting into his palm. Beside him, Pell's eyes had gone cold and sharp. Sim's lips moved in what might have been prayer or curse.

*Six months ago, he would have walked away.* The thought hit him like a physical blow. He'd seen scenes like this before—slavers moving their cargo, children in chains, the whole ugly business of human commerce. Always told himself it wasn't his fight. The Guild was too powerful, too connected. One sword couldn't change the world.

But now, looking at those children, his brand throbbed with remembered pain. The metal had burned when they'd pressed it to his flesh, and the chains had rubbed his wrists raw during those first days. His fingers traced the scar tissue unconsciously. The old Gond would have calculated odds, counted risks, found reasons to walk away.

This Gond's stomach churned at the sight of those shackles.

"We can't let this pass," Gond whispered, his voice rough as grinding stone.

Sim nodded, that surprising steadiness settling over his features. "Carefully."

Gond sketched his plan in quick, harsh whispers. "Pell, wide flank. Free the horses. Sim, stay low, retrieve the animals after. I'll take the guards."

Pell melted into the tall grass without a sound. Gond counted to thirty, then stepped onto the trail with an easy grin plastered across his face.

"Ho there!" He raised his hand in greeting. "Lost a wheel up the road—could use some help."

The lead slaver squinted, recognition dawning too slowly. By the time his hand moved toward his sword, Gond was already inside his guard. The boathook caught him across the temple with a wet crack.

Chaos erupted. Pell burst from cover, his knife flashing as he severed the horses' traces. The startled animals reared, eyes rolling white with terror, nostrils flaring at the sudden scent of blood. They bolted a dozen paces, hooves drumming against the packed earth, before stopping to crop grass with nervous, sideways glances at the violence behind them.

The rear guard's crossbow bolt hissed past Gond's arm, grazing it but flying wide. He lunged forward, hooking the man's leg and sending him sprawling. Two quick blows from the iron hook finished the job. Pell's blade found the third slaver before he could draw steel.

In moments, three bodies lay still in the dust. Sim moved calmly to the terrified children. As he passed, Pell grinned and handed him a key ring—his fingers had been busy during the fight, working even as his blade found its mark. The shackles fell away with metallic clinks.

Next, Sim went to collect the horses. "Easy," Sim murmured to the horses, approaching with carrots salvaged from the scattered supplies. Despite the scent of blood thick in the air, his gentle manner soon had them calm and willing.

Pell grinned as he counted coins. "Good haul." His eyes gleamed with satisfaction. "These weapons the guards were carrying are much better than that old boathook."

Gond knelt beside the fallen slavers, examining the row of weapons they'd recovered. One slaver had been armed with crossbow and dagger, while two carried standard mercenary blades, well-maintained but cheap-the kind of cheap weapon men carried when they couldn't afford better. One of the swords was nearly black, more iron than steel by the look of it.

His fingers closed around the leather-wrapped hilt. The balance felt wrong, the weight distributed poorly, yet something about it called to him. He lifted it, testing the edge against his thumb. Sharp enough, despite its rough appearance.

"That one's garbage," Pell observed, hefting the other sword. "Take this one, it's got better balance. I'll keep the crossbow and dagger."

Gond shook his head, sliding the dark blade through his belt. "This one will do."

Pell shrugged, slinging the crossbow on his shoulder. "Your funeral."

Gond only nodded, his gaze already scanning the horizon for more threats, the crude sword's weight somehow comforting at his side.

By evening, they'd made camp beneath a spreading pine. Gond tended his wounded arm—the crossbow bolt had left a shallow furrow—while Sim cared for the children's injuries with soft hymns and gentle hands. Pell secured their perimeter, moving like a shadow between the trees.

The silence stretched until Gond finally spoke. "We can't continue openly toward Blackwater. Too dangerous now."

"Then what?" Pell asked, settling beside the fire.

Gond traced Maera's map in the dirt with a stick. "The way-station. Defensible, hidden. You'll be safe there while I go to Blackwater alone."

Pell opened his mouth to protest, but something in Gond's expression killed the words. Sim placed a hand on the boy's shoulder—Dax, he'd said his name was. "You're making the right choice. Protecting these lives comes first."

"I'll return after I've finished by business there." Gond stood, his shadow long in the firelight.

The gentler of the two cart horses carried the injured Dax, while the other carried the supplies they'd looted from the caravan. There were enough for perhaps two weeks if they were frugal and supplemented with game.

Dawn found them at the ancient way-station, its moss-covered stones half-hidden by climbing ivy. They quickly helped the boy down, stored supplies, and secured the horses.

Before departing, Gond clasped Pell's shoulder. "Keep them safe. One week. If I'm not back, go back to Maera. She's sure to take the children or find a home for them." They had learned that the children's family had all been killed during their capture.

Sim grasped Gond's forearm, warmth and trust clear in his steady gaze. "Safe travels."

Gond nodded once, then turned toward the forest trail. Behind him, a young voice called softly, "Thank you."

The simple words hit him like a physical blow. He straightened his shoulders and lengthened his stride toward Blackwater, carrying the weight of their trust like armor against whatever waited ahead.
