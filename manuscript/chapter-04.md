## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 4 – Crack in the Chain

Gulls wheeled overhead, their harsh cries cutting through the salt-heavy air. Gond, Pell, and Sim moved along the cliff-top path, cloaks snapping in the stiff breeze. Darach still lay leagues ahead, but the prickle between Gond's shoulder blades warned that danger stalked closer.

Mid-morning, Pell dropped to a crouch beside flattened thicket. Gond joined him, studying the crushed grass and broken branches. Nearby, Sim examined trampled lavender stalks, his fingers tracing the damage.

"Five, maybe six." Gond's voice came out flat. "Slave-catchers."

Sim straightened, brushing dirt from his hands. "Fresh tracks. Less than an hour."

"Fantastic." Pell adjusted the rope across his shoulder. "I was beginning to miss trouble."

Gond's knuckles whitened around the boathook. They had little chance against seasoned slavers, but the alternative was watching more innocents dragged away in chains. "Stay sharp."

The trail descended into rolling dunes where voices drifted upward on the wind. Gond raised his fist, and the others froze. Below, a narrow wagon creaked toward the coast road, drawn by two sturdy horses. Two slavers lounged on the driver's bench, relaxed as men counting easy coin. A third walked alongside, whip coiled at his belt like a sleeping snake.

Behind the wagon stumbled two young captives—a boy and girl, heavy chains dragging at their ankles. The girl's shoulders shook with silent sobs.

Gond's jaw clenched so hard his teeth ached. His free hand curled into a fist, nails biting into his palm. Beside him, Pell's eyes had gone cold and sharp. Sim's lips moved in what might have been prayer or curse.

"We can't let this pass," Gond whispered, his voice rough as grinding stone.

Sim nodded, that surprising steadiness settling over his features. "Carefully."

Gond sketched his plan in quick, harsh whispers. "Pell, wide flank. Free the horses. Sim, stay low, retrieve the animals after. I'll take the guards."

Pell melted into the tall grass without a sound. Gond counted to thirty, then stepped onto the trail with an easy grin plastered across his face.

"Ho there!" He raised his hand in greeting. "Lost a wheel up the road—could use some help."

The lead slaver squinted, recognition dawning too slowly. By the time his hand moved toward his sword, Gond was already inside his guard. The boathook caught him across the temple with a wet crack.

Chaos erupted. Pell burst from cover, his knife flashing as he severed the horses' traces. The startled animals bolted a dozen paces before stopping to crop grass, indifferent to the violence behind them.

The rear guard's crossbow bolt hissed past Gond's ear, close enough to part his hair. He lunged forward, hooking the man's leg and sending him sprawling. Pell's blade found the third slaver before he could draw steel.

In moments, three bodies lay still in the dust. Sim moved calmly to the terrified children, producing a set of lock picks from somewhere in his robes. The shackles fell away with metallic clinks.

"Easy," Sim murmured to the horses, approaching with carrots salvaged from the scattered supplies. Despite the scent of blood thick in the air, his gentle manner soon had them calm and willing.

Pell grinned as he counted coins and tested a sword's balance. "Good haul." His eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

Gond only nodded, his gaze already scanning the horizon for more threats.

By evening, they'd made camp beneath a spreading pine. Gond tended his wounded arm—the crossbow bolt had left a shallow furrow—while Sim cared for the children's injuries with soft hymns and gentle hands. Pell secured their perimeter, moving like a shadow between the trees.

The silence stretched until Gond finally spoke. "We can't continue openly toward Darach. Too dangerous now."

"Then what?" Pell asked, settling beside the fire.

Gond traced Maera's map in the dirt with a stick. "The way-station. Defensible, hidden. You'll be safe there while I go to Darach alone."

Pell opened his mouth to protest, but something in Gond's expression killed the words. Sim placed a hand on the boy's shoulder—Dax, he'd said his name was. "You're making the right choice. Protecting these lives comes first."

"I'll return with answers." Gond stood, his shadow long in the firelight.

Dawn found them at the ancient way-station, its moss-covered stones half-hidden by climbing ivy. They stored supplies quickly, secured the horses, and helped injured Dax onto the gentler of the two mounts.

Before departing, Gond clasped Pell's shoulder and pressed his sword into the rogue's hands. "Keep them safe. One week. If I'm not back, go to Maera."

Sim grasped Gond's forearm, warmth and trust clear in his steady gaze. "Safe travels."

Gond nodded once, then turned toward the forest trail. Behind him, a young voice called softly, "Thank you."

The simple words hit him like a physical blow. He straightened his shoulders and lengthened his stride toward Darach, carrying the weight of their trust like armor against whatever waited ahead.
