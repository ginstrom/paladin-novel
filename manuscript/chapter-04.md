## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 4 – Crack in the Chain

Gulls circled high above, their cries cutting sharply through the salty air. Gond, Pell, and Sim moved quietly along the cliff-top path, their cloaks billowing in the stiff breeze from the sea. Darach still lay far ahead, but danger felt closer by the hour.

Mid-morning, Pell suddenly stopped, crouching beside a flattened thicket. Gond joined him, examining the crushed grass and broken branches. Nearby, Sim studied broken lavender stalks carefully.

"Five, perhaps six," Gond muttered grimly. "Slave-catchers, fresh tracks."

Sim looked up solemnly. "Less than an hour ahead. We need caution."

"Fantastic," Pell said dryly, adjusting the rope slung over his shoulder. "I was beginning to miss trouble."

Gond tightened his grip on the boathook he had fashioned into a weapon, his jaw set. They had little chance against seasoned slavers, but doing nothing wasn't an option. "Stay alert," he warned softly, moving forward again.

The trail descended steeply into dunes, the sounds of voices drifting upward clearly. Gond halted sharply, signaling the others to silence.

Below, a narrow wagon moved slowly toward the coast road, drawn by two sturdy horses. Two slavers sat on the driver's bench, relaxed and unaware, while a third walked beside the cart, whip coiled ominously at his belt. Behind them staggered two young captives—a boy and a girl, bound by heavy chains. The girl whimpered softly, fear evident in her every step.

Rage surged in Gond's chest, hot and fierce. He glanced quickly at his companions, assessing their odds. Pell's eyes were sharp with anger, Sim quietly murmured a prayer.

"We can't let this pass," Gond whispered urgently, his voice shaking slightly.

Sim nodded calmly, a surprising steadiness in his gentle demeanor. "We must tread carefully."

"Agreed," Gond replied tersely, quickly outlining a plan. "Pell, flank wide and free the horses. Sim, you keep low and retrieve the animals afterward. I'll distract the guards."

Pell nodded curtly, vanishing swiftly into the tall grass. Gond took a deep breath, descended the slope carefully, and stepped boldly onto the trail.

"Ho there!" he called, adopting an easy, confident grin. "Lost a wheel up the road—could use a hand."

The lead slaver squinted suspiciously, recognition dawning too slowly. Before he could raise the alarm, Gond was already upon him, swinging the boathook with deadly accuracy. Chaos erupted immediately. Pell burst from cover, his knife flashing quickly as he cut the horses' traces. The startled animals bolted a short distance, stopping to graze indifferently as the cart lurched, its contents spilling across the ground.

The rear guard fired hastily, a crossbow bolt slicing through the air, grazing Gond's arm. Ignoring the sharp pain, Gond surged forward, hooking the slaver’s leg and pulling him down with brutal efficiency. Pell swiftly dispatched another, his movements fluid and deadly.

Amid the turmoil, Sim moved calmly to the frightened children, freeing their shackles quickly. Once clear, he softly approached the horses, speaking quietly, offering carrots from the scattered supplies. Despite their initial fear at the scent of blood, Sim's gentle manner soon calmed them.

In moments, it was over. Three slavers lay incapacitated or dead, the captives freed, and their spoils gathered—weapons, food, blankets, and silver. Pell grinned fiercely, counting coins and testing a sword's balance.

"Good haul," he remarked, satisfied. Gond only nodded grimly, eyes thoughtful.

By evening, they camped beneath a sturdy pine, eating quietly. Gond tended his wounded arm while Sim gently cared for the children's injuries, murmuring soothing hymns. Pell busied himself securing their perimeter.

After a long silence, Gond finally spoke. "We can't continue openly toward Darach. It's too dangerous now."

"Then what's your plan?" Pell asked quietly, watching Gond carefully.

"There's a way-station," Gond explained, tracing Maera's map in the dirt. "We’ll hide you all there. It's defensible, hidden. I’ll head to Darach alone."

Pell's protest died swiftly beneath Gond's firm gaze. Sim offered quiet reassurance. "You're making a wise choice, Gond. Protecting these lives is our priority."

"I'll return with answers," Gond promised solemnly, rising with determination.

At dawn, they reached the ancient, moss-covered way-station. Supplies were quickly stored, horses secured, and injured Dax gently settled atop one of the horses to ease his pain.

Before departing alone, Gond clasped Pell's shoulder, handing over his sword. "Keep them safe. One week. If I'm not back, head to Maera."

Sim grasped Gond's forearm, warmth and trust in his steady gaze. "May Alanyi light your way."

Gond nodded once, resolute, turning toward the forest trail. Behind him, a young voice called out softly, "Thank you."

The simple gratitude pierced him deeply, reinforcing the weight of responsibility he now carried. He lengthened his stride toward Darach, heart hardened yet filled with renewed purpose.
