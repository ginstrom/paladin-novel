# The Reluctant Paladin

## Part IV: Forging a Free Nation

### Chapter 21: A House Divided

The first defectors arrived at dawn—a column of twenty knights in travel-stained armor, their banners torn and their faces grim. At their head rode Sir Marcus Brightwater, a man Gond recognized from Elena's intelligence reports as one of the Noble Knights' most respected commanders.

"Sir Roderick won't be pleased," Elena observed from the settlement's walls.

"Sir Roderick can go hang himself," Sir Marcus called out as he approached the gates. "We've come to join the true fight."

Gond met them in the settlement's center, flanked by Thorek and Silviana. The contrast between this group and Sir Roderick's delegation was stark—these knights looked like they'd been through hell, their expensive armor dented and bloodied.

"What happened?" Gond asked.

Sir Marcus dismounted heavily, his movements those of a man pushed beyond exhaustion. "Civil war. The Noble Knights have split down the middle. Half still believe we can reform the system from within. The other half..." He gestured to his battered companions. "We've seen enough."

"Seen enough of what?"

"The truth." Sir Marcus's voice carried bitter anger. "Three days ago, we raided a plantation outside Westmarch. Found children in the fields, some no older than eight. When we demanded their release, the overseer showed us a contract signed by Sir Roderick himself."

The words hit like physical blows. Gond felt divine power stir in his chest, responding to his anger.

"Roderick's been playing both sides," Sir Marcus continued. "Talking about honor and reform while his family profits from child slavery. When we confronted him..." He touched a bandage on his forehead. "Let's just say the discussion became heated."

"So you left?"

"We were expelled. Branded as traitors to the order and enemies of the crown." Sir Marcus's laugh was harsh. "Funny thing is, they were right. We are traitors—to a system that deserves to burn."

Thorek stepped forward, studying the knights with professional interest. "How many more like you?"

"Maybe thirty, scattered across three kingdoms. The rest are either true believers in the old ways or too afraid to act." Sir Marcus met Gond's eyes. "We know we can't undo what we've been part of. But we can try to make amends."

"And what do you want from us?"

"A chance to fight for something worth dying for."

The integration of the Noble Knight defectors proved more challenging than Gond had anticipated. Unlike the refugees and former slaves who'd joined them, these men came with ingrained assumptions about hierarchy and command that clashed with the settlement's egalitarian principles.

"I don't take orders from a dwarf," Sir Garrett Blackwood declared during his first training session with Thorek.

The war-priest's response was swift and educational. Within seconds, Sir Garrett found himself flat on his back, Thorek's warhammer resting gently against his throat.

"In this army," Thorek said conversationally, "you take orders from whoever knows what they're doing. Right now, that's me. Any questions?"

Sir Garrett's eyes blazed with indignation, but he was smart enough to recognize superior skill when it was demonstrated so clearly. "No questions."

"Good. Now get up and try that shield work again. And this time, listen when I tell you to keep your guard up."

Similar scenes played out across the settlement as former nobles learned to work alongside former slaves, dwarves, and elves. Some adapted quickly, recognizing that survival trumped social convention. Others struggled with concepts that challenged everything they'd been taught about the natural order.

"It's like training children," Elena complained after a particularly frustrating session. "They know how to fight, but they don't know how to fight together."

"Give them time," Gond replied. "They've spent their whole lives believing they were better than everyone else. That kind of thinking doesn't change overnight."

"Do we have time? The reports from the south aren't encouraging."

She was right. Intelligence from Maera's network painted a grim picture. The slave cities' alliance had grown to include five major ports and their inland territories. Their army now numbered over four thousand professional soldiers, supported by siege engines, cavalry, and a fleet of warships.

But there was other news as well—news that offered hope.

"The Temple of Alanyi in Westport has declared independence from the High Temple," Sim reported during the evening briefing. "They're calling themselves the Reformed Order and pledging support to our cause."

"How many temples have joined them?" Silviana asked.

"Seventeen so far, with more declaring every day. The established hierarchy is losing control."

Thorek grinned fiercely. "About time. The Iron Covenant has been waiting two centuries for the human orders to remember what they're supposed to stand for."

"It's not just the temples," Maera added. "We're getting reports of uprisings in three provinces. Slaves breaking their chains, sympathetic nobles opening their armories, even some royal guards deserting to join local liberation movements."

Gond studied the map spread across the table, marked with pins showing friendly and hostile forces. The pattern was clear—the continent was splitting along ideological lines, with the old order on one side and the forces of change on the other.

"We're not just fighting a war anymore," he said quietly. "We're fighting a revolution."

"The question is whether we can coordinate it," Elena pointed out. "All these separate uprisings are brave, but they'll be crushed individually unless we can unite them."

"That's where our new allies come in," Silviana said. "The Circle of Whispers has been in contact with elven communities across the continent. They're prepared to provide support—weapons, supplies, intelligence."

"And the Iron Covenant stands ready to march," Thorek added. "Two thousand dwarven warriors, armed with the finest weapons our forges can produce."

Sir Marcus leaned forward. "The Noble Knight defectors can provide something else—knowledge of enemy positions, supply lines, weaknesses in their defenses. We know how they think because we used to be them."

Gond felt the pieces of a larger strategy beginning to form in his mind. Three armies, three approaches, three chances to strike at the heart of the slave trade.

"Here's what we're going to do," he said, his finger tracing routes on the map. "Three coordinated campaigns, launched simultaneously. The elves and their allies will strike at the northern slave routes, cutting off supplies and reinforcements. The Iron Covenant will assault the inland strongholds, using their siege engines to break fortified positions."

"And us?" Pell asked.

"We take the coastal cities. The heart of the slave trade, where the ships dock and the auctions are held." Gond's smile was sharp as winter wind. "We're going to end this where it started."

***

The next few days passed in a blur of preparation. Messages flew between allied forces, coordinating timing and objectives. Weapons were distributed, supplies gathered, final training conducted.

But it was the arrival of an unexpected delegation that truly marked the beginning of the end.

"Riders approaching from the east," the lookout called. "Flying the banner of the Reformed Order."

Gond met them at the gates, surprised to see Sister Marta leading a group of twenty priests and priestesses. The young woman who'd witnessed his healing of Lily now wore the robes of a senior cleric, her bearing confident and determined.

"Sister Marta," he greeted her. "This is unexpected."

"The Reformed Order has voted," she announced formally. "We stand with the true paladin of Alanyi, not the corrupt hierarchy that has forgotten her teachings."

Behind her, the other clerics nodded their agreement. Gond recognized several faces from various temples, men and women who'd risked everything to follow their conscience.

"What about the High Temple?" Sim asked. "What's their response?"

Sister Marta's expression darkened. "High Cleric Aldric has declared us heretics and apostates. He's called for a holy war against all who support you."

"A holy war?" Silviana's voice carried dangerous undertones. "How very... traditional of him."

"It gets worse," Sister Marta continued. "He's allied with the slave cities, claiming that their cause is divinely ordained. They're calling it a crusade to restore proper order."

Gond felt pieces clicking into place in his mind, connections forming that painted a horrifying picture. "The false priests we encountered—the ones claiming to serve Kemiss. They revealed something about a master plan."

"What kind of plan?" Sir Marcus asked.

"The systematic weakening of Alanyi's influence," Silviana said, her ancient eyes wide with understanding. "The corruption of the religious orders, the elevation of commerce over compassion, the spread of slavery as an institution blessed by false divine authority."

"Gorlatch," Thorek growled, his hand moving to his warhammer. "The banned god's followers have been working for centuries to corrupt the very foundations of faith."

Sister Marta's face went pale. "You're saying the slave trade itself was designed as a weapon against the divine?"

"Think about it," Gond said grimly. "Every slave auction blessed by corrupt priests. Every temple that turned from mercy to profit. Every time commerce was declared more sacred than compassion. It wasn't just greed—it was a deliberate campaign to poison the well of faith itself."

The implications were staggering. The established religious hierarchy wasn't just opposing Gond politically—they were actively supporting a centuries-long plan to corrupt divine worship itself.

"Then we know where we stand," Gond said quietly. "No more pretense, no more half-measures. This is war."

"What are your orders?" Sir Marcus asked.

Gond looked around at the faces surrounding him—human, dwarf, and elf united in common cause. Former slaves and former nobles, priests and warriors, all bound together by a shared vision of freedom.

"Send word to all our allies," he said. "The time for preparation is over. In three days, we march."

***

The final council meeting before the campaign was held in the settlement's largest hall, packed with representatives from every faction in their growing alliance. The diversity was remarkable—dwarven war-priests sat beside elven mages, reformed nobles debated strategy with former slaves, and priests of the Reformed Order blessed weapons alongside Iron Covenant battlemasters.

"The northern force is ready," reported Captain Lyralei, speaking for the elven contingent. "Five hundred warriors, supported by mages and scouts. We'll strike at the supply routes through the Thornwood."

"The Iron Covenant stands prepared," Thorek declared. "Two thousand hammers, ready to break whatever walls stand in our way."

"And the coastal assault?" Elena asked.

Gond stood, feeling the weight of command settle on his shoulders. "Fifteen hundred fighters, including our newest allies. We'll hit three cities simultaneously—Saltmere, Blackwater, and Port Sorrow. Cut the head off the serpent."

"The risks are enormous," Maera warned. "If any of the attacks fail, the others will face reinforced opposition."

"The risks of doing nothing are greater," Gond replied. "Every day we wait, more people suffer in chains. Every day we delay, the enemy grows stronger."

He moved to the great map that dominated one wall, pointing to the marked positions. "This is our moment. Three armies, three objectives, one goal—the complete destruction of the slave trade."

"And after?" Sir Marcus asked. "What happens when the fighting's done?"

Gond looked around the hall at the faces watching him—faces that represented every race, every class, every background imaginable. They'd proven that cooperation was possible, that people could work together despite their differences.

"After, we build something better. A nation where freedom isn't just the absence of chains, but the presence of opportunity. Where worth is measured by character, not birth. Where the strong protect the weak instead of exploiting them."

"A pretty dream," someone called out. "But can it work on a large scale?"

"Look around you," Gond replied. "A year ago, this settlement didn't exist. Six months ago, we were just refugees hiding in the hills. Now we're leading a continental revolution. If we can do this, we can do anything."

The hall erupted in cheers, voices raised in a dozen languages but united in purpose. As the sound washed over him, Gond felt something he'd never experienced before—not just hope, but certainty.

They were going to win.

That night, as the settlement prepared for war, Gond walked among his people one last time. Tomorrow, many of them would march to battle. Some wouldn't return. But tonight, there was only quiet determination and the bonds forged through shared struggle.

He paused at the workshop where Grimjaw was making final adjustments to his siege engines. The massive dwarf looked up from his work, gold teeth flashing in the lamplight.

"Ready for tomorrow, lad?"

"As ready as anyone can be for something like this."

"Aye, well, that's the thing about revolutions. Nobody's ever really ready for them. They just happen when they need to happen."

Gond nodded, watching the dwarf's skilled hands work. "Any regrets? About leaving your old life behind?"

Grimjaw's laugh was like distant thunder. "My old life was building weapons for kings who used them to keep slaves in chains. This?" He gestured to the engine that would soon be breaking down the walls of slave cities. "This is what I was meant to build."

As Gond continued his rounds, he found similar sentiments everywhere. Former slaves who'd found purpose in liberation. Former nobles who'd discovered honor in service. Priests who'd rediscovered their faith by serving the oppressed instead of the powerful.

The house of the old order was indeed divided, split between those who clung to tradition and those who embraced change. But from that division, something new was being born—a nation founded on principles of freedom and equality that had never been tried on such a scale.

Tomorrow would bring the ultimate test. Three armies would march against an enemy that outnumbered them and outgunned them. The odds were long, the risks enormous.

But as Gond looked out over the settlement—at the workshops and training grounds, the council halls and healing centers, the homes where former enemies had become friends—he felt no doubt.

They'd already won the most important victory. They'd proven that a better world was possible.

Now all they had to do was fight for it.

The revolution was about to begin.
