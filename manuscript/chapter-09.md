# The Reluctant Paladin

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 9: Hunters and Hunted

The next morning dawned hot and sultry. The cicadas were already producing their summer cacaphony by the time Gond's party had cleared the valley.

The horses' hooves made soft sounds on the damp earth, as they whickered gently. Behind him, the volunteers moved with the quiet discipline he'd drilled into them—Pell, Korven, Lira, and nine others whose families depended on this mission's success.

The Thornfield farmstead lay two hours south through increasingly dangerous territory. Every step took them closer to the smoke columns they'd seen on the horizon, closer to the systematic destruction that crept northward like a plague.

Gond raised his hand, bringing the column to a halt. Something had changed in the air around them—a subtle shift that made his skin prickle with warning. He dismounted, pressing his ear to the ground.

"What is it?" Pell whispered, sliding from his saddle to join him.

"Riders." Gond's voice was barely audible. "Coming from the east. Maybe a dozen, moving fast."

The volunteers exchanged worried glances. They were still an hour from the farmstead, exposed on open ground with nowhere to hide except a thin line of scrub oak fifty yards to their left.

"Slavers?" Korven asked, his hand moving instinctively to his sword hilt.

Gond closed his eyes, extending his senses in ways he still didn't fully understand. The approaching riders moved with military precision, their horses shod and well-trained. Professional. Dangerous.

"Yes." He opened his eyes, his decision made. "Into the trees. Now. Lead the horses."

The volunteers moved with practiced efficiency, leading their mounts into the scrub oak and tying them deep in the shadows. Gond positioned his people in a rough line, each hidden behind trunk or boulder, weapons ready but orders clear—no one moved unless he gave the signal.

The sound of hoofbeats grew louder, accompanied by the jingle of mail and the creak of leather. Gond peered through the branches, counting the approaching riders. Six men in the colors of the Coastal Slavers Guild, their equipment professional and well-maintained. These weren't the desperate bandits who sometimes raided isolated farms—these were soldiers.

"Thornfield's been picked clean," one of the riders called to his companions as they passed. "Nothing left but bones and ash."

"What about the other sites on the map?" another voice replied. "The hidden camps?"

"We'll hit them in sequence. The one marked in the northern valley should be next—maybe tomorrow, depending on how long it takes to regroup."

Gond's blood turned to ice. They were talking about his valley, his people. The systematic destruction was even closer than he'd feared.

The slavers continued past, their voices fading as they rode north toward destinations that made Gond's stomach clench with dread. He waited until the sound of hooves disappeared entirely before signaling his people to emerge from hiding.

"Did you hear that?" Lira whispered, her face pale.

"Every word." Gond's jaw was set in grim lines. "Which means we need to move fast. Get what we can from Thornfield and get back to warn the others."

They retrieved their horses and continued south, but the mood had changed. What had been a dangerous supply run was now a race against time. Every minute they spent away from the valley was another minute their families remained unaware of the approaching threat.

The Thornfield farmstead appeared through the morning mist like a ghost of better times. The main house stood intact but empty, its windows dark and door hanging open. Outbuildings clustered around it—barn, smokehouse, root cellar, grain storage. Exactly what they needed, if the slavers had left anything behind.

"Spread out," Gond ordered quietly. "Check every building, but stay alert. If I give the signal, drop everything and run for the horses."

The volunteers dispersed with purpose. Pell and Korven headed for the grain storage, while Lira led a team to the smokehouse. Gond made his way to the root cellar, hoping the slavers had overlooked the underground stores.

The heavy wooden door creaked as he lifted it, revealing stone steps descending into darkness. The air that rose from below was cool and dry—perfect for preservation. He descended carefully, his eyes adjusting to the gloom.

Barrels lined the walls, filled with salted pork, dried beans, preserved vegetables. Sacks of grain sat stacked in neat rows. The family had prepared well for winter, and the slavers had apparently been more interested in people than provisions.

"Gond!" Pell's voice carried from the grain storage. "You need to see this."

He climbed from the cellar to find Pell standing beside the storage building, his expression a mixture of amazement and concern.

"They left everything," Pell said, gesturing to the interior. "Wheat, barley, oats—enough to feed our people for months. But why? Slavers usually take anything valuable."

Gond studied the untouched stores, his tactical mind working through the implications. "Because they're not planning to come back this way. They're clearing the region permanently—no point in preserving supplies for future raids."

The realization hit him like a physical blow. This wasn't just about capturing refugees for the slave markets. Someone was systematically emptying the entire region of free settlements, preparing the land for something else entirely.

"Load everything we can carry," he ordered. "Fill every sack, every barrel we brought."

For the next two hours, the volunteers worked with desperate efficiency. They loaded grain sacks onto pack horses, filled water barrels with preserved meat, stuffed their saddlebags with dried vegetables and medicinal herbs from the farmhouse garden. Every pound they could carry was another day their community could survive.

As they prepared to depart, Gond took one last look at the abandoned farmstead. A family had lived here, worked this land, built their dreams in these buildings. Now it stood empty, another casualty in a war most people didn't even know was being fought.

"Ready?" Pell asked, checking the straps on his heavily loaded pack horse.

Gond nodded, swinging into his saddle. "Let's go home."

The return journey felt longer despite their urgency. The horses moved slowly under their heavy loads, and every sound made the volunteers reach for weapons. But Gond's enhanced senses detected no immediate threats—the slavers had continued north, probably to regroup before their next assault.

They reached the valley as the sun touched the western peaks, their arrival greeted with cheers that quickly turned to concerned murmurs as word spread of what they'd overheard. Gond called an immediate gathering, the entire community clustering around the central fire as he shared the grim news.

"They know about us," he said without preamble. "Professional slavers with detailed maps, moving systematically through the region. They'll reach us within days."

The faces looking back at him showed fear, but also determination. These people had found hope in their hidden valley, and they wouldn't surrender it without a fight.

"What do we do?" Sim asked quietly.

Gond looked around the circle of upturned faces—men and women who had trusted him with their lives, children who deserved a chance to grow up free. The weight of their faith settled on his shoulders like a mantle.

"We've had our respite," he announced without preamble. "Now we prepare for war."

The words hit like stones dropped into still water, ripples of unease spreading through the crowd. But these were no longer the broken, desperate fugitives who had first stumbled into their sanctuary. Weeks of good food, safety, and purpose had transformed them into something resembling a community.

Korven, the surly man who had once challenged Aerin over food, stepped forward. His tone held none of its former hostility. "What do you need us to do?"

Gond's mind was already mapping their defensive strategy, seeing the flow of battle before it began. "Pell, take a team and set snares along the main approaches. Nothing lethal—we want to slow them down, not announce our presence with screams."

He turned to Sim. "Organize the non-combatants. Evacuation routes, supply caches, places to hide the children."

The priest nodded, already moving toward the families with young ones.

"The rest of you," Gond continued, his voice carrying to every corner of the gathering, "we're going to turn this valley into a fortress. Every advantage we can create, every trap we can set, every defensive position we can fortify—we use them all."

The refugees dispersed with purpose, but Gond caught the overconfident glances some of the newcomers exchanged. They believed their remote valley made them untouchable. His instincts, sharper than ever, screamed otherwise.

The next day, Gond crouched at the ridge's edge, scanning the horizon for the expected raiders. He turned to Pell and Sim. "They're coming soon."

Pell frowned. "How can you be so certain?"

Gond couldn't explain the certainty that gripped him, the way his skin seemed to prickle with awareness of distant threats. The sensation was like standing in an open field before a lightning strike—every nerve screaming of imminent danger.

"Call it intuition."

"Your intuition's been remarkably accurate lately," Sim noted, joining their conversation. "Almost as if you're receiving guidance from a higher source."

"Don't start," Gond warned, but there was no real heat in his voice. He was beginning to accept that something had changed in him, even if he couldn't—or wouldn't—name what that something was.

A flicker of movement on the opposite ridge. "They're here!" His voice carried clearly through the morning air, but now it was a signal to his hidden watchers, not a call to battle. "About fifteen of them! Positions!"

The refugees rushed to the ambush points they had drilled

"Now," Gond whispered, and melted into the forest like a ghost.
