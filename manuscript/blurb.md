# Paladin's Rise - Book Jacket Blurb

Gond never figured betrayal would come with a slave brand burned into his forehead. The cynical mercenary's predictable life shattered when his own comrades drugged him and sold him to slavers bound for the salt mines—where most survive only months. But his betrayers underestimated him. Breaking free with broken chains and brute force, Gond washes ashore driven by a thirst for revenge that should have been simple to satisfy. Instead, he finds himself protecting escaped slaves, children, and a gentle priest whose talk of divine mercy sounds like madness to a blade-for-hire. When mystical encounters manifest around ancient temple ruins and his wounds heal impossibly fast, Gond faces an inconvenient truth: the gods have plans for him that don't involve the vengeance he craves. In a world where slavery is blessed by corrupt temples and freedom means death, can one reluctant mercenary become the instrument of divine justice an entire continent desperately needs?
