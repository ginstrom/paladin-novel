# The Reluctant Paladin

## Part V: The War for Freedom

### Chapter 24: Coastal Storm

The attack began before dawn, when the world existed in that gray space between night and day. Gond crouched in the sacred tunnel beneath Darach, listening to the muffled sounds of his strike team preparing for the assault above. The ancient passage stretched ahead into darkness, its walls carved with elven symbols that seemed to pulse with their own faint light.

"The other teams are in position," Pell whispered, appearing at his shoulder like a ghost. "Elena's group has reached the harbor gate, and Thorek's dwarves are under the eastern wall."

Gond nodded, checking his weapons one final time. Sword, dagger, crossbow—the tools of his old trade, but serving a new purpose. Around him, twenty of his best fighters waited in tense silence, their faces painted with mud to avoid reflection in the pre-dawn gloom.

"Remember," he said quietly, "we're not here to slaughter everyone we see. We're here to open the gates and free the slaves. Kill when you have to, spare when you can."

A few nods, though he could see the skepticism in some eyes. Old habits died hard, and many of these fighters had personal scores to settle with the slavers.

Above them, the first siege engine spoke with a voice like thunder.

The sound rolled through the tunnel like a physical thing, shaking dust from the ancient stones. Grimjaw's engines had begun their bombardment of the outer walls, right on schedule. Soon the defenders would be rushing to man the battlements, leaving the inner city less heavily guarded.

"That's our signal," Gond said, rising to his feet. "Let's go free a city."

They moved through the tunnel in single file, following Silviana's glowing map toward the exit beneath the slave market. The passage climbed steadily, and Gond could feel the weight of the city above them—thousands of people going about their morning routines, unaware that their world was about to change forever.

The tunnel ended at a stone grate set into the floor of what looked like a storage cellar. Through the iron bars, Gond could see stacks of grain sacks and wine barrels, and beyond them, a wooden staircase leading up to street level.

"Guards?" he whispered to Pell.

The scout pressed his ear to the grate, listening intently. "Two, maybe three. Sounds like they're playing dice."

Gond drew his dagger and tested the grate. The ancient hinges protested but gave way with only a soft squeal of metal. He lifted it just enough to slip through, then gestured for the others to follow.

The cellar smelled of grain and old wine, with an underlying stench that spoke of the slave pens somewhere above. Gond moved between the storage containers like a shadow, his mercenary training taking over despite the years since he'd last needed such skills.

The guards were exactly where Pell had said they'd be—three men in slaver colors sitting around a small table, their attention focused on a game of bones. Empty wine cups suggested they'd been at it for a while.

Gond struck fast and silent, his dagger finding the first guard's throat before the man could cry out. The second guard started to rise, reaching for his sword, but Pell's blade took him in the chest. The third managed to open his mouth to shout before Gond's pommel struck his temple, dropping him unconscious to the floor.

"Bind him," Gond ordered, wiping his blade clean. "He might have useful information."

They climbed the stairs to find themselves in the heart of Darach's slave market. Even at this early hour, the pens were full—men, women, and children huddled together in cages barely large enough for animals. The sight hit Gond like a physical blow, bringing back memories of his own captivity with painful clarity.

"Sweet Alanyi," one of his fighters breathed. "There must be hundreds of them."

"More," Gond said grimly. "And this is just one market."

The sound of siege engines grew louder, punctuated now by the crash of stone against stone as Grimjaw's bombardment found its targets. Shouts echoed from the direction of the walls as defenders rushed to their positions.

"The keys," Gond said, pointing to a ring hanging from a hook near the market overseer's desk. "Start opening the cages. Tell them to stay quiet until we secure the area."

As his team spread out to free the slaves, Gond climbed to the market's upper level, where a window gave him a view of the harbor. What he saw made his blood run cold.

Ships. Dozens of them, anchored in the deep water beyond the harbor mouth. Not merchant vessels or fishing boats, but warships flying the colors of half a dozen coastal cities. The slavers had called in reinforcements from across the continent.

"Problem?" Pell asked, joining him at the window.

"Big one." Gond pointed toward the fleet. "They've got more ships than we planned for. If those are full of soldiers..."

"Then we're outnumbered three to one instead of two to one," Pell finished. "Still think we can win?"

Gond was quiet for a moment, watching smoke rise from the outer walls where Grimjaw's engines were doing their work. "We have to. Too many people are counting on us to fail now."

A commotion from below drew their attention. The freed slaves were emerging from their cages, blinking in the dim light like people waking from a nightmare. Some wept, some prayed, some simply stood in stunned silence. All bore the marks of their captivity—brands, scars, the hollow look of people who'd given up hope.

"You're free," Gond called down to them, his voice carrying clearly in the sudden quiet. "The liberation army is here. But we need your help to finish this."

An older man stepped forward, his back straight despite the slave brand on his forehead. "What do you need?"

"Fighters, if you're willing. Guides who know the city. People to help free the other markets." Gond descended the stairs, meeting the man's eyes. "But only volunteers. You've suffered enough."

"I'll fight," the man said without hesitation. "Name's Marcus. Used to be a soldier before they took me. Still remember which end of a sword to hold."

Others stepped forward—not all, but enough. Men and women who'd been beaten down but not broken, who still had fight left in them. Gond felt a familiar warmth in his chest, the divine power responding to their courage and determination.

"Arm them from the guard posts," he ordered his team. "Marcus, you know the city. What's the fastest way to the main gate?"

"Through the merchant quarter, but it'll be heavily guarded now that the attack's started." The former soldier studied Gond with sharp eyes. "You're him, aren't you? The one they call the Reluctant Paladin."

"I'm the one trying to end this," Gond said simply. "That's all that matters."

They moved through the city in small groups, using back alleys and side streets to avoid the main thoroughfares where slaver forces were mobilizing. The sound of battle grew louder as they approached the walls—the crash of siege engines, the shouts of defenders, the screams of the wounded.

At the merchant quarter's edge, they encountered their first real resistance. A company of mercenaries had set up a barricade across the main street, their crossbows trained on the approaches. Behind them, Gond could see the massive gates that led to the harbor—their primary objective.

"Twenty men, good positions," Pell reported after a quick reconnaissance. "We could take them, but not quietly."

"Quiet's overrated," Gond said, drawing his sword. "Besides, I think it's time to announce ourselves properly."

He stepped into the street, making no attempt at concealment. The crossbowmen spotted him immediately, their weapons swinging to track his movement.

"I am Gond of the Liberation Army," he called out, his voice carrying clearly in the morning air. "I offer you one chance to lay down your weapons and walk away."

The mercenary captain laughed, a harsh sound that echoed off the surrounding buildings. "One man against twenty? You paladins really are as mad as they say."

"Not one man," Gond said, raising his hand. Divine light blazed from his palm, bright as the sun and twice as warm. "One paladin. And he's not alone."

His fighters emerged from the alleys and side streets, surrounding the barricade. But more importantly, the freed slaves appeared at windows and doorways, their presence a visible reminder of what this fight was really about.

The mercenaries wavered, their confidence shaken by the display of divine power and the sight of so many determined faces.

"Last chance," Gond said, the light in his hand growing brighter. "Choose."

Half the mercenaries threw down their weapons and fled. The other half, either braver or more foolish, opened fire.

Gond moved like lightning, the divine power flowing through him and enhancing every motion. Crossbow bolts passed through empty air as he closed the distance to the barricade. His sword sang as it cut through armor and flesh, each strike precise and economical.

Behind him, his fighters poured into the street, their battle cries mixing with the clash of steel on steel. The fight was brief but vicious, ending when the last mercenary fell with Pell's dagger between his ribs.

"The gates," Gond ordered, already moving toward their objective. "Get them open before—"

The sound of hoofbeats cut him off. A company of heavy cavalry rounded the corner at full gallop, their lances lowered and their armor gleaming in the morning light. At their head rode a figure Gond recognized with a shock of mixed emotions.

Borin. His former friend and betrayer, now wearing the colors of a slaver captain and bearing down on him with murder in his eyes.

Time seemed to slow as the cavalry charge closed the distance. Gond could see every detail with crystal clarity—the foam on the horses' mouths, the determination on the riders' faces, the particular way Borin held his lance that spoke of countless hours of practice.

The old Gond would have met that charge with rage and bloodlust, seeking personal vengeance above all else. But the man he'd become had more important concerns.

"Scatter!" he shouted to his fighters. "Don't let them pin you down!"

His people melted away into doorways and alleys, leaving the street clear for the charging cavalry. All except Gond himself, who stood his ground in the middle of the road, his sword held ready.

Borin's lance point aimed straight for his heart.

At the last possible moment, Gond sidestepped and brought his sword up in a rising cut that took the lance head clean off. Borin's horse thundered past, the rider fighting to control his mount as it skidded on the cobblestones.

The rest of the cavalry charge broke apart as Gond's fighters emerged from cover, attacking the horses' legs and pulling riders from their saddles. It was brutal, efficient work—the kind of urban fighting that favored defenders over attackers.

When the dust settled, half the cavalry lay dead or wounded in the street. The survivors had fled, all except one.

Borin sat his horse at the far end of the street, his sword drawn and his face a mask of conflicted emotions. For a moment, neither man moved, the weight of their shared history hanging between them like a physical thing.

"You could have killed me," Borin said finally, his voice carrying clearly in the sudden quiet.

"I could have," Gond agreed. "But I didn't."

"Why?"

Gond looked at the man who'd once been his friend, seeing not the betrayer who'd sold him into slavery, but the scared soldier who'd made a terrible choice in a moment of desperation.

"Because killing you won't free a single slave," he said simply. "Because revenge is a luxury I can't afford. Because the man I used to be died in those chains, and the man I became has more important work to do."

Borin's sword wavered, confusion replacing the anger in his eyes. "I don't understand."

"You will," Gond said, turning away from his former friend. "Someday, when you're ready to choose who you want to be instead of who you think you have to be."

He walked toward the gates, leaving Borin sitting alone in the street. Behind him, he could hear the sound of hoofbeats as his former friend rode away—not toward the battle, but toward the city's edge and whatever redemption he might find beyond its walls.

The harbor gates were massive things, reinforced with iron and designed to withstand siege. But they were also old, and the mechanisms that controlled them were housed in a guardhouse that Gond's team had already secured.

"Can you work it?" he asked Marcus, who was studying the gate controls with a professional eye.

"Give me five minutes," the former soldier replied, already examining the counterweight system. "These are military grade, but the principle's the same as any fortress gate."

While Marcus worked, Gond climbed to the guardhouse roof to survey the battle. What he saw both encouraged and worried him.

The outer walls were breached in three places, Grimjaw's siege engines having done their work with devastating efficiency. Liberation forces poured through the gaps, engaging slaver defenders in running battles through the outer city. But the enemy fleet in the harbor was moving, warships closing on the docks to disembark fresh troops.

"How long until those ships reach the harbor?" he called down to Pell.

"Twenty minutes, maybe less," came the reply. "And they're big ships. Could be carrying a thousand men or more."

Gond felt the familiar weight of impossible choices settling on his shoulders. They needed to hold the harbor to prevent enemy reinforcements, but they also needed to push inland to link up with the main army. And somewhere in the chaos, thousands of slaves waited in pens and markets throughout the city, depending on the liberation forces to free them.

"The gates are opening!" Marcus shouted from below.

The massive portals swung wide with a groan of ancient hinges, revealing the harbor beyond. Liberation ships waited in the deeper water—not warships, but converted merchant vessels carrying supplies and reinforcements. They began moving toward the docks immediately, racing to reach shore before the enemy fleet could intercept them.

"Signal the ships," Gond ordered. "Tell them to land everything they can before those warships arrive. We're going to need every fighter we can get."

As his people rushed to carry out his orders, Gond found himself thinking about the choice he'd made with Borin. The old Gond would have called it weakness, a failure to take proper revenge. But the man he'd become understood that some victories were more important than others.

The sound of marching feet drew his attention back to the immediate crisis. A column of slaver reinforcements was approaching from the inner city—professional soldiers in good armor, moving with the discipline of veteran troops.

"How many?" Pell asked, joining him on the roof.

"Two hundred, maybe more." Gond checked his weapons, feeling the divine power stirring in response to the approaching threat. "Too many to fight directly."

"So what do we do?"

Gond looked out over the harbor, where liberation ships were racing toward the docks while enemy warships closed from the opposite direction. In the distance, he could see smoke rising from Millhaven and Westport, signs that the coordinated assault was proceeding as planned.

"We do what we came here to do," he said, climbing down from the roof. "We free the slaves, hold the harbor, and trust our people to do the same."

The battle for Darach's harbor was about to begin in earnest.

***

The enemy column reached the harbor district just as the first liberation ship touched the dock. Gond watched from behind an overturned cart as professional soldiers deployed with practiced efficiency, their officers shouting orders and pointing toward the strategic positions around the harbor.

"They know what they're doing," Marcus observed, crouching beside him. "These aren't city guards or hired thugs. These are real soldiers."

"Good," Gond said, surprising the former soldier. "That means they'll fight with honor instead of butchering civilians."

"It also means they'll be a lot harder to beat."

"Everything worthwhile is hard." Gond checked his crossbow, making sure the bolt was properly seated. "That's what makes it worthwhile."

The liberation ship disgorged its cargo of fighters—a mix of freed slaves, sympathetic soldiers, and volunteers from the inland villages. They formed up on the dock with admirable speed, but Gond could see they were outnumbered by the approaching enemy column.

"We need to even the odds," he said, rising from cover. "Marcus, take half our people and hit them from the left flank. Pell, you take the rest and circle around to their rear. I'll give you a distraction."

"What kind of distraction?" Pell asked suspiciously.

Gond smiled, feeling the divine power building in his chest like a warm fire. "The obvious kind."

He stepped into the street, making himself a clear target for the enemy archers. Crossbow bolts immediately began flying in his direction, but the divine power guided his movements, allowing him to dodge with inhuman grace.

"I am Gond of the Liberation Army!" he shouted, his voice carrying clearly over the sounds of battle. "I call upon all who serve the cause of freedom to stand with me!"

The response was immediate and overwhelming. Windows opened throughout the harbor district as freed slaves and sympathetic citizens emerged from hiding. They carried whatever weapons they could find—kitchen knives, carpenter's tools, broken bottles—but their faces blazed with the kind of determination that no amount of professional training could match.

The enemy column wavered as they found themselves surrounded by angry civilians. Their discipline held, but Gond could see uncertainty in their ranks as they realized they were facing not just an army, but an entire population in revolt.

"For freedom!" Gond roared, raising his sword high. Divine light blazed from the blade, bright enough to be seen across the entire harbor. "For justice! For the future we're going to build together!"

The charge that followed was unlike anything in the military manuals. Freed slaves fought alongside professional soldiers, elderly merchants stood shoulder to shoulder with young farmers, and through it all, Gond moved like an avatar of divine wrath, his sword cutting through enemy ranks with supernatural precision.

The battle was brief but decisive. Faced with an entire population in revolt and a paladin whose blade seemed to cut through armor like cloth, the enemy column broke and fled toward the inner city.

"The harbor's ours," Marcus reported, breathing hard from the fighting. "But those warships are almost here."

Gond looked out over the water, where the enemy fleet was closing fast on the docks. Each ship bristled with armed men, and their combined forces would easily outnumber the liberation troops currently holding the harbor.

"Signal the other ships," he ordered. "Tell them to land everything they have, then pull back to safe distance. We'll hold the docks as long as we can."

"And when we can't hold them anymore?"

"Then we fall back to the inner city and make them pay for every street." Gond wiped his sword clean, already planning the next phase of the battle. "But we don't give up. We never give up."

As the enemy warships closed on the harbor, Gond found himself thinking about the larger battle raging across the continent. In Millhaven and Westport, liberation forces would be fighting similar battles against similar odds. Far to the north, the Noble Knights would be assaulting the Holy City of Turin, seeking to cut the head off the corrupt Marshal Order.

It was an ambitious plan. Maybe an impossible one.

But as he watched freed slaves and liberation fighters preparing to defend the harbor they'd just won, Gond found himself believing it might just work.

The war for freedom had brought them this far.

Now it was time to finish what they had started.

The first enemy ship reached the dock just as the sun climbed above the horizon, painting the harbor in shades of gold and crimson. The battle for Darach—and the future of the continent—was about to enter its final phase.

***

The enemy marines hit the dock like a steel wave, their shields locked and their spears leveled. Professional soldiers trained for amphibious assault, they moved with the kind of coordination that spoke of countless hours of drill and practice.

Gond met them at the water's edge, his sword blazing with divine light. The first spear thrust passed harmlessly through empty air as he sidestepped and brought his blade down in a cut that sheared through the marine's shield and the arm holding it. The man's scream was lost in the clash of steel on steel as the two forces collided.

"Hold the line!" Gond shouted, parrying a sword thrust and riposting with a cut that opened his attacker's throat. "Don't let them establish a beachhead!"

But even as he fought, he could see more ships approaching the dock. The enemy had committed their full strength to retaking the harbor, and the liberation forces were badly outnumbered.

A crossbow bolt took one of his fighters in the chest, spinning the man around before he collapsed to the dock. Another marine broke through the line, only to be tackled by a freed slave wielding a boat hook like a spear.

"We can't hold them!" Marcus shouted over the din of battle. "There are too many!"

Gond looked around desperately, seeking some advantage that might turn the tide. The harbor was a maze of docks and warehouses, with narrow alleys and chokepoints that could favor defenders if used properly.

"Fall back to the warehouse district!" he ordered. "Make them come to us on our terms!"

The liberation forces began a fighting withdrawal, using the dock's infrastructure to break up the enemy advance. Marines found themselves funneled into narrow passages where their numerical advantage meant nothing, facing desperate fighters who knew every inch of the terrain.

But the enemy kept coming, ship after ship disgorging fresh troops onto the docks. For every marine that fell, two more took his place. The liberation forces were being ground down by sheer attrition.

Then the enemy's secret weapon revealed itself.

A new ship approached the dock—larger than the others, its hull painted black and its sails bearing symbols that made Gond's blood run cold. As it drew near, he could see figures on its deck that weren't soldiers. They wore the dark robes of corrupt clerics, their hands already weaving patterns in the air that spoke of malevolent magic.

"Evil clerics!" Gond shouted, recognizing the threat immediately. "Everyone down!"

The wave of fear hit like a physical blow, washing over the harbor district with supernatural force. Liberation fighters dropped their weapons and fled screaming, their courage shattered by magical terror. Even the freed slaves who'd been cheering from windows and doorways disappeared, cowering in whatever shelter they could find.

Gond felt the fear trying to take hold of him—a cold, creeping dread that whispered of failure and death. But as the magical terror reached for his heart, something else responded. His sword blazed brighter, its blue-white light cutting through the supernatural darkness like a beacon.

He raised the blade high and stepped forward into the wave of fear. Where the divine light touched the magical terror, it simply ceased to exist. The sword carved a path of calm through the supernatural storm, and in its wake, courage returned.

"With me!" Gond roared, his voice carrying clearly through the fading echoes of magical fear. "The light conquers all darkness!"

His fighters rallied behind him, their terror replaced by determination as they followed in the wake of his blazing sword. The divine light spread outward from the blade, creating a zone of courage that pushed back the clerics' magic.

The enemy marines, who'd been advancing confidently behind their magical support, suddenly found themselves facing an enemy that refused to break. Worse, they could see their own fear-magic being cut apart by a sword that blazed like a star.

Gond charged toward the black ship, his blade leaving a trail of blue-white light in the air. The corrupt clerics tried to focus their magic on him directly, but the divine radiance surrounding his sword simply absorbed their spells and grew brighter.

He leaped from the dock to the ship's deck, landing among the startled clerics like an avenging angel. His sword sang as it cut through their ranks, each strike precise and economical. Where the blade touched corrupted flesh, divine fire blazed, purifying the darkness that had taken root in their souls.

The last cleric fell with a scream that was part terror, part relief, as the divine light freed him from whatever dark power had claimed him. The magical fear that had paralyzed the harbor district died with its casters, leaving behind only the ordinary courage of people fighting for their freedom.

"The clerics are down!" Gond shouted, raising his still-blazing sword. "Press the attack!"

The liberation forces surged forward with renewed vigor, their fear replaced by righteous fury. The enemy marines, deprived of their magical support and facing an enemy whose blade seemed to cut through steel like cloth, began to waver.

That's when the miracle happened.

A new sound echoed across the harbor—not the clash of weapons or the shouts of battle, but something else entirely. A deep, resonant note that seemed to come from the very stones of the city itself.

Gond looked up to see a sight that made his heart leap with hope. The inner walls of Darach were opening, their massive gates swinging wide to reveal the main liberation army. Grimjaw's siege engines had done more than breach the outer defenses—they'd punched all the way through to the city's heart.

"Reinforcements!" someone shouted, and the cry was taken up by fighters throughout the harbor district.

The main army poured through the gates like a flood, three thousand liberation fighters led by Elena Brightblade herself. They hit the enemy marines from behind, catching them between two forces and turning the tide of battle in an instant.

The fighting that followed was fierce but brief. Caught between the harbor defenders and the main army, the enemy marines fought with the desperation of trapped animals. But desperation was no match for superior numbers and divine intervention.

When the last marine fell or surrendered, an eerie quiet settled over the harbor. Smoke drifted from burning ships and buildings, and the water was stained red with blood, but the docks belonged to the liberation army.

"Status report," Gond said, finding Elena among the celebrating fighters.

"Darach is ours," she replied, her armor splattered with blood but her eyes bright with victory. "The outer walls are breached, the inner city is secured, and the slave markets are being emptied as we speak."

"Casualties?"

"Heavy, but not as bad as we feared. The enemy fought hard, but they weren't prepared for a coordinated assault from multiple directions." Elena's gaze moved to Gond's still-glowing sword. "And they definitely weren't prepared for that. I saw you cut through their fear magic like it was nothing."

Gond looked down at his blade, which was slowly fading back to its normal silver radiance. "The sword has its own will when it comes to fighting evil. I just pointed it in the right direction."

"What about the other cities?"

"Millhaven fell two hours ago. Westport is still fighting, but our forces have breached their walls. It's only a matter of time."

"And Turin?"

Elena's expression grew serious. "No word yet. But if the Noble Knights succeeded in their assault, we should hear something soon."

As if summoned by her words, a messenger appeared at Gond's elbow—a young elf bearing the colors of the Circle of Whispers.

"My lord," the messenger said, bowing deeply. "I bring word from the north. The Holy City of Turin has fallen. The corrupt Marshal Order is broken, and the Noble Knights have secured the city."

A cheer went up from the nearby fighters, but Gond held up a hand for silence.

"What of the High Marshal? And the other corrupt leaders?"

The messenger's expression grew solemn. "Dead, my lord. All of them. Turin himself manifested during the final assault—divine wrath made visible. Those who had perverted his teachings were struck down where they stood."

Gond felt a chill run down his spine. He'd heard stories of direct divine intervention, but he'd never expected to see it in his lifetime.

"The god of justice took a personal interest in cleaning house," Elena observed quietly. "Can't say I'm surprised."

"What does this mean for us?" Gond asked the messenger.

"The Circle of Whispers declares the war won, my lord. With the Marshal Order broken and the coastal cities liberated, the slave trade has no central authority to coordinate resistance. Individual cities may hold out for a time, but the system itself is finished."

Another cheer went up, louder this time, and Gond didn't try to stop it. They'd done it. Against all odds, they'd actually done it.

But even as he celebrated with his fighters, Gond's mind was already turning to the challenges ahead. Winning the war was only the beginning. Now they had to build something better in place of what they'd destroyed.

"Send word to all our forces," he told Elena. "Secure the cities, free the remaining slaves, and begin establishing provisional governments. And send messengers to every corner of the continent—let everyone know that the age of slavery is over."

"What about you?" she asked. "What will you do now?"

Gond looked out over the harbor, where liberation ships were already arriving with supplies and reinforcements. In the distance, he could see freed slaves emerging from the warehouses and markets, blinking in the sunlight like people waking from a long nightmare.

"I have one more thing to take care of," he said quietly. "Something personal."

Elena followed his gaze and seemed to understand. "Borin and Kael?"

"If they're still alive. If they're willing to listen." Gond checked his weapons, though he hoped he wouldn't need them. "It's time to finish what I started all those months ago."

"And if they're not willing to listen?"

"Then I'll do what I have to do." Gond started walking toward the inner city, where reports suggested the last pockets of resistance were being mopped up. "But I'm hoping it won't come to that."

As he made his way through the liberated streets of Darach, Gond passed a group of freed slaves huddled near a fountain. Many bore fresh wounds from the battle, but it was the older scars that drew his attention—the brands that marked them as property, burned into foreheads and hands with deliberate cruelty.

An elderly woman looked up as he approached, her eyes widening with recognition. "You're him," she whispered. "The Paladin of Mercy."

"I'm just a man trying to help," Gond said gently, kneeling beside a wounded child. The boy couldn't have been more than ten, his arm badly cut and his forehead bearing the twin circles of slavery. "May I?"

The woman nodded, tears streaming down her cheeks as Gond placed his hands on the child's wounds. Divine light flowed from his palms, knitting torn flesh and easing pain. But as the healing progressed, something unexpected happened.

The brand on the boy's forehead began to fade, the raised scar tissue smoothing away as if it had never existed. Within moments, unmarked skin remained where the slave mark had been burned.

Gasps echoed from the watching crowd as they witnessed the impossible—not just healing, but the complete erasure of slavery's mark.

"The brands," the elderly woman breathed, touching her own marked forehead with trembling fingers. "You can remove them?"

"It seems I can," Gond said, as surprised as anyone by this new manifestation of his power. He looked around at the gathered faces, seeing hope kindle in eyes that had known only despair. "Who else needs healing?"

They came forward then, one by one—men, women, and children bearing the scars of bondage. Gond touched each brand with gentle hands, watching as divine light erased not just the physical marks but the spiritual wounds they represented. Each healing left unmarked skin and renewed dignity in its wake.

"Free," the elderly woman whispered, staring at her reflection in the fountain's water. For the first time in decades, her forehead bore no mark of ownership. "Truly free."

As he made his way through the liberated streets of Darach, Gond reflected on how much had changed since that first desperate escape from the slave ship. He'd started this journey seeking revenge against the men who'd betrayed him. Now he found himself hoping for their redemption instead.

It was a strange feeling, but not an unwelcome one.

The war for freedom was won. Now it was time to see if the peace that followed could be built on mercy instead of vengeance.

The future of the continent might depend on it.
