# The Reluctant Paladin

## Part III: An Unlikely Saint

### Chapter 16: Allies and Enemies

The delegation arrived three days after Maera's war council, announced by the sound of bells—not the harsh clang of alarm, but the melodious chiming of ceremonial instruments. From the watchtower, Gond could see them approaching: a procession of robed figures moving with the measured pace of religious ceremony, their banners bearing symbols he recognized from Sim's teachings.

"Holy orders," Silviana said, joining him on the platform. Her usually serene expression was troubled. "Multiple orders, by the look of it."

Gond counted the banners as they drew closer. The crossed hammers of Turin's Battlemasters dominated the procession, their armor gleaming despite the dust of travel—clearly the ascendant power among the holy orders. The intertwined circles of Alanyi were present but fewer, carried by only two figures who seemed diminished beside Turin's representatives. And others he didn't recognize: a golden sun, a silver moon, a stylized flame.

"They're not here for healing," Pell observed, appearing beside them with his usual silent grace. "Look at the formation—that's a diplomatic mission, not a pilgrimage."

Indeed, the approaching group moved with the careful precision of people engaged in delicate negotiations. At their head rode a figure in elaborate robes, his bearing suggesting high rank within whatever hierarchy he represented.

"Trouble?" Thorek asked, climbing up to join them.

"Probably," Gond replied. "The question is what kind."

They had their answer within the hour, as the delegation reached the settlement's edge and requested formal audience with "the one called Gond, who claims the title of Paladin." The phrasing was carefully neutral, but Gond caught the underlying challenge.

The meeting was arranged in the settlement's council area, with representatives from both sides seated around the central fire. Gond took his place flanked by Silviana and Thorek, while Sim sat slightly apart—his position as a member of one of the visiting orders creating an obvious conflict of loyalties.

The leader of the delegation proved to be High Cleric Aldric, leader of Turin's ascendant followers, a man whose expensive robes bore the crossed hammers of the god of justice. His soft hands spoke of a life spent far from the hardships his god supposedly championed. When he spoke, his voice carried the practiced authority of someone accustomed to being obeyed.

Beside him sat a thin, nervous priest in the faded robes of Alanyi—one of only two representatives of the once-mighty order. Brother Castor's eyes darted constantly to Aldric, as if seeking approval for his very presence.

"Gond of the Valley," he began formally, "I come bearing greetings from the Council of Sacred Orders, and questions that require answers."

"Ask them," Gond replied simply.

Aldric's smile was thin and cold. "Very well. By what authority do you claim the title of Paladin? Who ordained you? What tests did you pass? What vows did you swear?"

The questions hung in the air like accusations. Around the circle, Gond could see the tension building—his people bristling at the implied challenge, while the visiting clerics watched with calculating eyes.

"I claim no title," Gond said finally. "I am what I am. The divine power that flows through me is its own authority."

"Divine power?" Aldric's tone suggested polite skepticism. "Many claim such things. Hedge wizards, charlatans, madmen—all insist their abilities come from the gods. What proof do you offer?"

"Yes, what proof?" Brother Castor echoed immediately, his voice shrill with nervous energy. "Charlatans and madmen, exactly as the High Cleric says. Where are your credentials? Your ordination papers?"

Before Gond could respond, Sim stood slowly. The gentle priest's face was pale but determined as he faced his superior.

"High Cleric," he said quietly, "I have witnessed this man's power firsthand. I have seen him heal wounds that should have been fatal, inspire courage in the face of overwhelming odds, and channel divine light in ways that leave no doubt of its source."

Aldric's gaze shifted to Sim, and Gond caught a flash of something cold and calculating in the High Cleric's eyes. "Brother Sim. Your reports have been... interesting. But personal testimony, however sincere, is not sufficient proof of divine calling."

"Then what would be sufficient?" Silviana asked, her voice carrying the musical cadence of elven speech.

The High Cleric turned to her with obvious distaste. "And you are?"

"Silviana Starweaver, Lore-keeper of the Circle of Whispers." Her introduction carried weight that even Aldric couldn't ignore. "I speak for the elven communities that remember Alanyi's true nature."

"The elves withdrew from human affairs centuries ago," Aldric said dismissively. "Your opinions carry little weight in matters of human religious authority."

"Perhaps," Silviana replied calmly. "But divine authority transcends human politics."

The exchange was interrupted by the arrival of another figure—a dwarf in armor that bore the crossed hammers of Turin's order, but with subtle differences that marked him as belonging to a different faction. He approached the circle with the confident stride of someone accustomed to command.

"Battlemaster Korgan Ironshield," he announced himself, settling onto a log without waiting for invitation. "I represent the Iron Covenant's interests in this matter."

Aldric's expression soured further. "The Iron Covenant has no standing in this discussion. You broke from the true faith two centuries ago."

"We preserved the true faith," Korgan replied bluntly. "While you corrupted it to serve slavers and tyrants."

The accusation hit the gathering like a physical blow. Several of the visiting clerics rose to their feet, hands moving toward weapons, while Gond's people tensed in response. For a moment, violence seemed inevitable.

"Enough," Gond said, his voice carrying a authority that cut through the rising tension. "We're not here to relitigate ancient grievances. High Cleric Aldric, you came seeking proof of divine calling. What would convince you?"

Aldric settled back into his seat, though his expression remained hostile. "The traditional tests. Theological examination by qualified scholars. Demonstration of specific divine abilities under controlled conditions. Submission to the authority of established religious hierarchy."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you would be declared a false prophet, your followers excommunicated, and your movement condemned as heretical." Aldric's smile was coldly satisfied. "The consequences would be... severe."

"Severe indeed!" Brother Castor added eagerly, wringing his hands. "Heretical movements must be stamped out before they spread their poison. The High Cleric speaks wisdom!"

Gond felt the divine power stirring within him, responding to the threat against those under his protection. But this wasn't a situation that could be resolved with healing or blessing. This was politics, pure and simple—an attempt to control or destroy what he'd built.

"I see," he said quietly. "And what of the slaves who've been freed? The refugees who've found sanctuary? The hope that's been kindled in the hearts of the oppressed? What happens to them if I submit to your authority?"

"That would depend," Aldric replied carefully, "on how cooperative you prove to be."

The implication was clear: submit, and perhaps some of what Gond had built would be allowed to continue under official oversight. Refuse, and it would all be swept away.

"There is another option," Korgan said into the tense silence. "Recognition by the Iron Covenant and our allies. We may not have the political power of the established orders, but we have something more valuable—legitimacy in the eyes of those who remember what divine service truly means."

"The Iron Covenant is a rebel faction," one of the other visiting clerics protested. "They have no authority to grant recognition."

"We have the authority of two millenium of faithful service," Korgan replied. "The authority of standing against corruption when others embraced it. The authority of preserving divine truth when others perverted it for political gain."

As the argument continued, Gond found himself studying the faces around him. The visiting clerics were clearly divided—some nodding along with Aldric's demands, others looking uncomfortable with the High Cleric's heavy-handed approach. His own people were watching him intently, waiting to see how he would respond to this challenge.

"May I ask a question?" Sim said suddenly, his quiet voice cutting through the debate.

Aldric turned to him with obvious irritation. "What is it, Brother?"

"When did the Order of Alanyi last send aid to the oppressed? When did we last stand against injustice, regardless of the political consequences?" Sim's voice grew stronger as he continued. "When did we last act like servants of the goddess of mercy and redemption? When did we last challenge the priests of Kemiss who bless slave auctions and call commerce more sacred than compassion?"

The question hung in the air like an accusation. Aldric's face flushed with anger. "The priests of Kemiss serve a legitimate deity. Commerce and trade are necessary for civilization—"

"Commerce built on human suffering is an abomination," Korgan interrupted. "Turin teaches that justice comes before profit, always."

"Easy words from those who don't understand the complexities of governance," Aldric shot back. "The world requires compromise, accommodation with existing power structures—"

"The world requires courage to stand against evil, regardless of the cost," Silviana said quietly. "That is what separates divine service from political expedience."

Before Aldric could respond, another voice joined the conversation.

"An excellent question," said a new arrival, stepping into the circle with the quiet confidence of someone accustomed to being heard. She was young, perhaps thirty, with the calloused hands of someone who worked for a living despite her clerical robes. "I'm Sister Marta of the Westport Temple. I've traveled here to see for myself what manner of man claims to serve our goddess."

Aldric turned to her with obvious relief. "Sister Marta. Your timing is fortuitous. Perhaps you can help this pretender understand the importance of proper religious authority."

But Marta's attention was focused on Silviana, her eyes bright with something approaching reverence. "Lore-keeper Starweaver," she said, inclining her head respectfully. "I have studied the old texts, the ones that speak of Alanyi's true nature before the orders became... political. Your presence here suggests this man may indeed carry the ancient blessing."

Silviana studied the young priest with interest. "You follow the old ways, Sister?"

"As best I can," Marta replied quietly. "The Westport Temple still maintains some of the original practices, though we must be... discrete about it." She glanced meaningfully at Aldric and Brother Castor. "I came here seeking guidance. If this man truly serves our goddess as the stories claim..."

"There's a child in my party," she continued, turning to Gond but clearly deferring to Silviana's judgment. "Born with a withered arm, useless since birth. Lore-keeper, would you counsel me to ask for healing? Is this the test that would reveal truth?"

Gond felt the divine power stirring in response to the challenge, but also something else—a sense that this moment would define everything that came after. Not just his relationship with the established religious orders, but the future of everything he'd built.

"Bring her forward," he said.

The child proved to be perhaps eight years old, her left arm twisted and malformed from birth. She approached with the careful dignity of someone who'd learned to live with disability, her eyes bright with curiosity rather than hope.

Gond knelt before her, placing his hands gently on her shoulders. "What's your name?"

"Lily," she said simply.

"Lily, I'm going to try to help your arm. It might feel strange, but it won't hurt. Is that all right?"

She nodded solemnly, and Gond placed his hands on her withered limb. The famliar feel of the divine power flowed through him, seeking out the malformed bones and twisted muscles. But this wasn't like healing a wound or curing a disease—this was reshaping something that had been wrong from birth, rewriting the very structure of her body.

The effort was enormous, drawing on reserves of divine energy Gond hadn't known he possessed. Around him, he could hear gasps of amazement as Lily's arm began to change, bones straightening, muscles filling out, skin taking on healthy color.

When it was finished, the child flexed her fingers experimentally, wonder dawning in her eyes as she realized she could move them freely for the first time in her life.

"Thank you," she whispered, then ran back to Sister Marta with tears of joy streaming down her face.

The circle was silent for a long moment, the implications of what they'd witnessed settling over everyone present. Finally, Sister Marta spoke.

"I've seen enough," she said quietly. "Your power was very great. This man carries divine blessing, whatever the politics of the situation might be."

"One miracle proves nothing," Aldric said, but his voice lacked its earlier conviction.

"Nothing at all!" Brother Castor chimed in desperately, though his voice wavered. "Tricks and illusions! The High Cleric is right to be skeptical!"

"It proves everything," Korgan replied firmly. "Divine power doesn't flow to the unworthy, regardless of what titles they claim or what authorities recognize them."

As the debate resumed, Gond found himself thinking about the choice before him. He could submit to the established orders, accept their oversight and limitations in exchange for official recognition. Or he could reject their authority entirely, accepting the consequences that would follow.

But as he looked around at the faces of his people—refugees who'd found hope, slaves who'd found freedom, fighters who'd found a cause worth dying for—he realized the choice had already been made.

"High Cleric Aldric," he said, rising to his feet. "I thank you for your offer, but I must decline."

The High Cleric's face darkened. "You refuse to submit to proper religious authority?"

"I refuse to submit to authority that serves politics rather than divine will," Gond replied. "I refuse to accept oversight from those who've forgotten what it means to serve the oppressed."

"Then you condemn yourself and all who follow you," Aldric said, standing as well. "The Council of Sacred Orders will declare you heretical. Your movement will be outlawed. Your followers will be excommunicated."

"So be it," Gond said simply.

As the official delegation prepared to depart, their mission clearly failed, Sister Marta approached Silviana and Gond quietly.

"Lore-keeper," she said, her voice filled with quiet determination. "I have learned much today. The old ways... they are not dead, are they? There are still those who remember Alanyi's true calling."

Silviana smiled gently. "The old ways endure, Sister. They wait for those with courage to embrace them again."

Marta turned to Gond. "You know what this means," she said quietly. "Open war with the established religious hierarchy. They'll use every tool at their disposal to destroy you."

"I know," Gond replied. "But some things are worth fighting for."

She studied his face for a long moment, then nodded slowly. "The Westport Temple still maintains the old practices in secret. We will remember what we witnessed here today—not just the healing, but the return of Alanyi's true servant. When the time comes to choose sides, we'll know where we stand."

As the various delegations departed—some in anger, others in thoughtful silence—Gond found himself standing with his core allies around the dying fire. The weight of what had just transpired settled over them like a heavy cloak.

"Well," Thorek said finally, "that could have gone better."

"Could have gone worse, too," Pell observed. "At least now we know where everyone stands."

"Do we?" Silviana asked. "The religious orders are clearly divided. Some will support the established hierarchy, others will question it. The real test will come when they're forced to choose between political expedience and divine truth."

Gond nodded, feeling the weight of leadership settling heavier on his shoulders. The legend of the healer in the hills was truly ending now, replaced by something far more complex and dangerous—a movement that challenged not just the slave trade, but the entire structure of religious and political authority.

"What happens now?" Sim asked quietly.

Gond looked around at the faces of his friends and allies, seeing determination mixed with apprehension. They'd crossed a line today, one that couldn't be uncrossed. The path ahead would be harder than anything they'd faced before.

"Now," he said, "we prepare for war. Not just against slavers and their allies, but against everyone who profits from the current system. It won't be easy, and it won't be quick. But it's necessary."

As the council dispersed and people returned to their various duties, Gond remained by the fire, staring into the flames and thinking about the future. This part of his journey was ending—the reluctant paladin had become something else entirely.

What came next would test everything he'd learned, everything he'd built, and everyone who'd chosen to stand with him. But for the first time since accepting his calling, Gond felt truly ready for whatever lay ahead.

The war for freedom was about to begin in earnest. And at its heart stood a former mercenary who'd learned that sometimes the greatest act of faith was refusing to compromise with those who'd forgotten what faith truly meant.

***

That night, as the settlement settled into its routines, Gond found himself walking the perimeter with Pell, checking the watch posts and thinking about the day's events.

"Any regrets?" the thief asked as they paused at the eastern lookout.

Gond considered the question seriously. "About refusing Aldric's offer? No. About what it means for everyone who follows me? That's harder to answer."

"They chose to be here," Pell pointed out. "Just like you chose to heal instead of hide, they chose to stand instead of run. Whatever comes next, it's their choice as much as yours."

"Is it? Or are they just following where I lead, trusting that I know what I'm doing?"

Pell was quiet for a moment, studying Gond's profile in the moonlight. "You know what the difference is between you and every other leader I've known?"

"What?"

"You actually care about the answer to that question." The thief's smile was barely visible in the darkness. "Most leaders assume they know what's best for everyone. You worry about whether you're worthy of the trust people place in you. That's what makes you worth following."

As they completed their circuit and returned to the settlement's heart, Gond felt some of the weight on his shoulders ease. The path ahead was uncertain, the challenges enormous, the stakes higher than ever before. But he wasn't walking it alone.

And perhaps, in the end, that would be enough.
