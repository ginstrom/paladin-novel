# Paladin's Rise

## Part V: The War of Restoration

### Chapter 23: The Shadow of Gorlatch

The army, a river of steel and prayer, flowed south. Each dawn painted the sky with hues of Alanyi’s hope, yet each morning also brought a subtle chill. Two days into their march from the encampment overlooking Saltmere’s distant promise, a disquieting pattern emerged. First, a dwarven scout, then a human forager, then another scout—this one elven—failed to answer morning muster.

Sir Marcus Brightwater, his newfound zeal for Alanyi’s cause still warring with ingrained Noble Knight disdain, was overheard muttering to his men about "lack of discipline" and "cowards finding their true colors." Gond, riding near the column's head with Elena and Silviana, caught the remark. His jaw tightened, but he said nothing, merely exchanging a glance with Maera. The spymaster’s network was already sifting through the ranks for whispers, for any hint of unease that might explain the disappearances.

"The dwarven front reports continued success at Blackrock Pass," a messenger announced, interrupting the somber mood of the morning briefing. "Thorek’s forces have pushed deeper, and the Pilgrim’s Rest shrine is now a beacon for refugees. He sends word that their masons are eager to assist Sim’s acolytes." Another rider, cloaked in forest green, followed. "Captain Lyralei confirms the Thornwood routes remain choked for Gorlatch’s lackeys. Several more corrupted way-shrines now sing with ancient elven clarity."

Gond nodded, the news a counterpoint to the gnawing worry. "The goddess blesses their efforts. See that our own resolve matches theirs."

The road wound through increasingly desolate country, the land itself seeming to hold its breath. It was here, in a narrow defile choked with thorny scrub, that first blood was shed. A volley of black-fletched arrows hissed from the ridge lines. Slaver loyalists, desperate and cornered, judging by their ragged appearance.

The column reacted with a discipline born of shared purpose. Dwarven shield-bearers formed a bulwark, their heavy armor deflecting the worst of the volley. Elven archers returned fire with deadly precision, their arrows finding marks with almost supernatural accuracy. Amidst the chaos, Sir Kaelen, one of Brightwater’s knights, found himself unhorsed, his leg pinned. A hulking slaver, brandishing a cruel-looking falchion, bore down on him. Before Kaelen could bring his own sword to bear, a figure in patched leather, a former quarry slave named Joric, slammed his rough-hewn shield into the slaver’s side, then drove a short spear through the man’s throat. Joric offered a calloused hand to the astonished knight. Kaelen, after a moment’s hesitation, grasped it, hauled to his feet by the man he might once have considered less than human. The knight’s muttered thanks was gruff, but his eyes held a new light.

The skirmish was brief, brutal, and ultimately, a small victory. But as Sim and his acolytes tended the few wounded, Gond noted the subtle shifts. Sir Kaelen sought out Joric, sharing a waterskin. A dwarven warrior clapped an elven archer on the shoulder, a gesture of rough camaraderie.

The true darkness, however, awaited them further down the road. As dusk fell, they made camp in a grove of petrified trees, their skeletal forms clawing at the fading light. A palpable sense of dread settled over the army.

It struck without warning. Not with the clash of steel, but with a creeping, insidious chill that seeped into the very marrow. Illusions flickered at the edge of vision: loved ones in peril, past failures replayed with agonizing clarity, grotesque figures whispering insidious doubts. Fear, cold and cloying, wrapped around hearts and minds. Several soldiers screamed, dropping their weapons to clutch their heads.

"Gorlatch!" Silviana hissed, her face pale but resolute as she began a counter-chant, her voice a thread of silver in the encroaching darkness.

Three figures emerged from the deepest shadows of the petrified grove, their forms cloaked and indistinct, yet radiating an aura of profound malice. "The Master of Chains remembers his servants, paladin," one rasped, the voice like stones grinding together. "You interfered with his tithes. Retribution is now due."

Gond felt the divine fire surge within him, Alanyi’s presence a burning shield against the psychic assault. "Your master’s due is oblivion!" he roared, drawing his sword. The blade blazed with a pure, white light, cutting through the oppressive gloom. He saw Elena stumble, her hand frozen on her sword hilt, her eyes wide with an unseen terror. Thorek stood rooted, his mighty warhammer hanging limp. Sim was on his knees, chanting desperately, but his voice wavered.

Without thought, Gond call up his light. He pushed the divine light outwards, a wave of courage and clarity that momentarily broke the hold of the fear-spell on his companions. Elena gasped, her sword clearing its sheath. Thorek let out a bellow and hefted his hammer.

The Gorlatch clerics redoubled their assault. Tendrils of shadow lashed out, and a sickly green mist, carrying the stench of decay and despair, began to drift through the camp. Gond met the shadow-tendrils with sweeps of his radiant blade, each impact sending shudders through the unholy energy. He felt only a slight tingling, but noted his companions wincing in pain and fear.

He ignored it, focusing the divine power. He held his sword aloft, and beam shot up from it, exploding in brilliance and lighting the sky. The scene was bathed in a golden glow, the shadw-tendrils melting under its brilliance. The three priests growled and faltered. Gond took his opportunity and drove the blade deep into the heart of the first, who crumpled to the ground. The remaining two faltered, their illusions flickering. Elena and Thorek, bolstered by Gond’s light, charged. Silviana’s counter-chant grew stronger, weaving a web of protective energy.

The battle was short but desperate. Gond battered the second cleric repeated with his sword until this one also slumped limply. The third, seeing its companions destroyed, attempted to flee but was caught by a perfectly aimed arrow from an elven archer who had shaken off the fear.

As the last vestiges of Gorlatch’s magic dissipated, a collective groan went up from the afflicted soldiers. Many were writhing, their skin clammy, the black poison coursing through them. Gond, swaying on his feet from the expenditure of power, moved among them. He laid his hands on the nearest, a young woman from the valley, her face contorted in agony. Alanyi’s light flowed, and the black ichor receded from her veins. He moved to the next, and the next, the divine energy pouring from him, also lending him strength so he could continue. By the time the last victim was cleansed, Gond collapsed, the light in his blade dimming. Sim and Silviana were at his side instantly, and guided him to a pallet.

Three days later, battered but unbroken, the army crested the final ridge. Below them lay Saltmere, its formidable walls a scar upon the coastline, the harbor choked with slaver galleys. The air, even at this distance, seemed tainted with the city’s misery.

As the army began to establish its siege lines, Maera’s chief scout, a wiry woman named Lyra, approached Gond, her face a mask of grim fury. "High Paladin. We found them. The missing."

She led Gond, Sim, and a grim-faced Sir Marcus to a ravine half a league from Saltmere’s western wall. The stench hit them first—a coppery, foul miasma that spoke of unimaginable suffering. In the ravine’s depths lay a pit. And in the pit, the bodies of the lost scouts and foragers. They had been tortured, their flesh bearing the unmistakable marks of Gorlatch’s ritual cruelty.

Two figures still clung to life, their breaths shallow, their eyes vacant with horrors seen. One was the dwarven scout, Borin Stonebeard, a distant cousin to Thorek. The other, the young human forager, Elara.

Gond knelt, his heart a cold stone in his chest. He reached for Borin, Alanyi’s light flaring in his hands. The dwarf’s wounds began to close, color returning to his ash-grey skin. His breathing deepened.

Then Gond turned to Elara. As he prepared to channel the healing light again, a profound stillness settled over him, a gentle but undeniable pressure from the divine presence within. *Ease her suffering, my son. But her path ends here. Her spirit yearns for release.*

Gond froze. The command was clear, unmistakable. He looked at Elara’s ravaged form, at the flicker of awareness returning to Borin’s eyes. The memory of a past defiance, a past insistence on his own judgment in matters of life and death, pricked at him. This time, the weight of Alanyi’s wisdom, her sorrow, was too profound to question. With tears stinging his eyes, he laid his hands on Elara. A soft, warm light enveloped her, not mending, but soothing. The pain lines on her face eased. A faint, almost peaceful sigh escaped her lips. And then, she was still.

Sim, who had witnessed the subtle shift in Gond’s demeanor, placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. Sir Marcus, his face pale, simply stared, the last vestiges of his noble arrogance stripped away by the raw horror and the quiet, terrible mercy he had just witnessed.

The discovery of the pit, and Elara’s passing, sent a wave of cold fury through the army. The siege of Saltmere began in earnest. Grimjaw’s engines, now bearing names like "Alanyi’s Judgment" and "Hope’s Hammer," were maneuvered into position, their crews working with grim determination. Elven archers took to the high ground, their arrows a constant harassment to the city’s defenders. Dwarven engineers began constructing siege towers, their hammers ringing like funeral bells for Saltmere’s reign of terror. The harbor was blockaded, Grimjaw’s largest catapults re-angled to deny entry or escape to any vessel.

On the third day of the siege, a white banner appeared above Saltmere’s main gate. A delegation of five individuals, robed and unarmed, emerged.

Gond met them in the no-man’s-land between the siege lines and the city walls, flanked by Sim, Silviana, Elena, and Thorek. The lead delegate, a portly man with shifty eyes, introduced himself as Guildmaster Theron.

"High Paladin," Theron began, his voice unctuous. "The council of Saltmere recognizes the… disruption your forces have caused. We are prepared to offer a compromise. A significant tribute, an agreement to limit certain… less savory aspects of our trade, in return for your army’s withdrawal."

Gond’s gaze was like chips of ice. "There is no compromise with darkness, Guildmaster. My terms are simple. Release every slave within your walls. Surrender every priest and acolyte of Gorlatch to our justice. And open your gates to the worship of Alanyi, that her light may cleanse the stain you have made of this city."

Theron’s face paled. "Those terms are… impossible."

"They are immutable," Gond stated. "Take them to your council. You have until dawn tomorrow to comply. After that, Alanyi’s judgment will fall."

The delegation, visibly shaken, promised to deliver the terms. They turned and began the slow walk back towards Saltmere’s gates. As they neared the walls, a volley of crossbow bolts suddenly erupted from the battlements. The delegates cried out, falling one by one, pierced by shafts fired by their own guards. One, a younger man, despite a bolt in his shoulder, managed to stagger, stumble, and half-crawl back towards Gond’s lines before collapsing.

Pell was the first to reach him. The young delegate, choking on his own blood, gasped, "Gorlatch… controls everything… They… they laughed at your terms… said the Master of Chains would feast…" His eyes glazed over.

The betrayal was absolute, the message chillingly clear. There would be no surrender.

Gond looked towards the bloodstained walls of Saltmere, his expression hard as granite. The setting sun cast long, menacing shadows from the siege engines, now silent sentinels of the retribution to come. The harbor lay still, a dark mirror under the twilight sky, effectively sealed. The army waited, a coiled spring of righteous fury.

The siege of Saltmere had truly begun.
