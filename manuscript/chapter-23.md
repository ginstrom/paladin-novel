# Paladin's Rise

## Part V: The War of Restoration

### Chapter 23: The First Tithe of Tears

The war council tent, once a place of strained alliances and grudging compromise, now buzzed with purposeful activity—voices no longer carried the sharp edge of suspicion, hands no longer hovered near weapon hilts during debates, and the very air seemed charged with shared conviction. Woodsmoke and old parchment still scented the air, but beneath it lay the almost palpable thrum of shared conviction, a resonance that had settled over them since Alanyi's voice had echoed through Gond. Maps of the Slavers' Coast still dominated the tables, but now, beside the grim fortifications of Saltmere, Blackwater, and Port Sorrow, new symbols had appeared—faded markings indicating ruined shrines, forgotten holy wells, places where Alanyi's light had once touched the land.

Gond stood before them, not as a desperate leader herding cats, but as an instrument honed and ready. The weariness was still etched around his eyes, but his gaze held a crystalline focus that seemed to pierce through surface concerns to the heart of each matter. His movements were economical yet fluid, each gesture deliberate, as if he could see the threads of fate weaving together before him. The faded brand on his forehead, once a source of shame, now seemed a mere shadow beneath the memory of divine light that many in this room had witnessed.

"Saltmere first," Gond stated, his voice calm but carrying the weight of the goddess's recent pronouncement. "Their harbor is deep, their slave pens overflowing. And," he tapped a newly inked circle on the map, "Sim believes this was once the site of the Sunken Grotto, a major temple to Alanyi before the slavers desecrated it."

Sim, his gentle face alight with a newfound, quiet authority, nodded. "The old texts are fragmented, but they speak of healing waters there, blessed by Alanyi's tears. According to the Chronicle of Sorrows, the Grotto was where pilgrims came to be cleansed of their deepest wounds—not just of body, but of spirit. The waters were said to flow from a spring that touched the goddess's own realm, carrying her compassion directly into our world. If we can reclaim and purify it…" He trailed off, the unspoken hope filling the silence.

"Reclaiming it is not enough," Silviana Starweaver added, her voice like the rustle of ancient leaves. "The corruption of Gorlatch runs deep in these places. The very stones will cry out. Purification rites will be needed, rites the elves remember, and which we will share with Sim's new acolytes." Her silver eyes met Gond's. "The tunnels I spoke of beneath Blackwater? Similar passages exist beneath Saltmere, older still. My ancestors walked those paths when the world was younger—they were carved not by mortal hands, but by the roots of the World Tree itself, following ley lines of power that predate human civilization. They can grant us entry, not just to the city's heart, but perhaps to the Grotto's foundations with minimal destruction."

Sir Marcus Brightwater, his armor still bearing the scars of his defection but his eyes now bright with a convert's zeal, leaned forward. "Using tunnels means fewer lives lost on the walls, both ours and theirs. A merciful approach for a sacred task." The transformation in the Noble Knight was remarkable; the man who had arrived seeking Turin's hammer now spoke Alanyi's language.

"Precisely," Gond affirmed. "Our aim is not mere conquest, but a cleansing. We offer every soul in Saltmere a choice: renounce the darkness or be consumed by it. But the stones, the land itself, these we reclaim for the light."

Elena Brightblade, ever the pragmatist, pointed to the wider map. "While we focus on Saltmere, what of the other fronts? The three prongs of our sacred campaign must strike in concert."

A dusty dwarven messenger, newly arrived, stepped forward. "Lord Thorek Ironheart sends word from the Dragon's Spine mountains, High Paladin." The title, still new, resonated with respect. "His Iron Covenant warriors have engaged the slaver garrisons at Blackrock Pass. The fighting is fierce, but they have broken through the outer defenses. He says, and I quote, 'We are not just smashing stone, we are carving out sanctuaries. Where their fortresses stood, Alanyi's peace will find footing, and Turin's true justice will guard it.' They have already secured the old Pilgrim's Rest shrine, long fallen to ruin, and dwarven masons are preparing to assist Sim's people in its reconsecration when the time is right."

A ripple of approval went through the council. Then, a slender elven scout, nearly invisible against the tent's canvas, spoke. "Captain Lyralei of the Thornwood strike force reports success. The Gorlatch-blessed supply caravans moving south from the Shadowfen are in disarray. We have… discouraged their passage." A faint, dangerous smile touched her lips. "Furthermore, our lore-keepers have located and begun the purification of three ancient elven way-shrines deep within the Thornwood, places where the natural harmony had been disrupted by Gorlatch's encroaching shadow. The land itself breathes easier."

Silviana nodded. "My kin understand that true war against such darkness is fought on many levels. While some elves engage in these necessary disruptions, my path as Alanyi's priestess is to preserve and heal. The knowledge of the tunnels is part of that, a way to achieve our aims with less blood spilled."

Gond absorbed the reports, a sense of interconnected purpose weaving through him. "Good. The pincers tighten, and the light spreads. Our assault on Saltmere will be the central blow. Elena, your forces will secure the tunnel entrance Silviana indicates. Grimjaw," he turned to the massive dwarf, "your engines will create a diversion at the main gates, draw their eyes while our true strike slips in."

Grimjaw's gold-capped teeth flashed. "A bit of noise to consecrate the occasion? My beauties will sing a hymn of breaking stone they won't soon forget!"

The days that followed were a blur of sacred preparation. In the settlement's expanded training grounds, an extraordinary sight unfolded: dwarven smiths worked alongside human blacksmiths, their hammers ringing in harmony as they forged weapons blessed by both Turin's strength and Alanyi's mercy. Elven fletchers taught former slaves the art of crafting arrows, their patient hands guiding rough fingers in the delicate work of balancing shaft and point. Weapons were not merely sharpened but blessed by Sim and his growing band of acolytes, human and even a few dwarven volunteers, all learning the nascent rites of a reborn faith under Silviana's patient tutelage. Armor was mended with prayers for protection. The army, once a desperate band of survivors, now moved with the quiet dignity of a congregation preparing for high holy service.

Sir Marcus and his former Noble Knights, initially struggling with the shift from pure retribution to merciful restoration, found themselves instructing former slaves in the use of sword and shield, their lessons now laced with talk of protecting the innocent and upholding Alanyi's grace. The irony was not lost on them, and it was humbling.

On the eve of their departure, Maera brought Gond a final piece of intelligence, her face grim. "A whisper from Saltmere, carried on the black market currents. Two names you know have been seen within the city's walls, commanding a mercenary company hired to bolster the defenses." She paused. "Borin and Kael."

The names struck Gond with the force of a physical blow, a cold shard of his past piercing the warmth of his present purpose. The faces of his former friends, twisted by betrayal, rose in his mind. The old Gond, the mercenary, would have felt a surge of vengeful satisfaction. The paladin felt a profound sorrow, and a weary resignation.

He closed his eyes for a moment, the divine presence a steady warmth within him. Alanyi's voice from the council chamber echoed in his memory: *In every act of mercy… I am there.*

"This changes nothing of our objective," Gond said, his voice quiet but firm. "Saltmere will be liberated. Alanyi's temple will be reclaimed."

Maera watched him, her sharp eyes missing little. "And if you face them?"

"Then I will offer them the same choice we offer every soul in that city: turn to the light, or be swept away with the darkness." He met her gaze. "Alanyi's mercy extends even to those who have lost their way. But her justice is also inevitable for those who cling to corruption."

Later that night, as the army lay encamped on a ridge overlooking the distant, starlit gleam of the sea, with Saltmere a smudge of deeper darkness on the horizon, Gond walked among his soldiers. He saw humans, dwarves, and a few elves sharing rations, their conversations a low murmur of anticipation and prayer. He saw Sim anointing a young soldier's shield with holy water, the boy's face earnest and hopeful.

He found Elena staring out towards the enemy city. "They say Saltmere's walls are built with the bones of slaves," she said, her voice tight. "That the mortar was mixed with their tears."

"Then we shall wash those walls with hope," Gond replied, standing beside her. "And rebuild its heart with compassion."

"You truly believe we can do this?" she asked, turning to him. "Not just win, but… heal?"

Gond looked at the sprawling camp, at the diverse souls united under a banner of almost impossible idealism. He thought of Alanyi's voice, of Sim's quiet faith, of Silviana's ancient wisdom, of Thorek's steadfast strength, of the courage of men like Sir Marcus who had dared to change.

"I believe Alanyi did not speak through me only to see us fail," he said. "The path is hard, the cost will be great. But yes, Elena. I believe. We are the tide, and the darkness cannot hold us back."

He was to address the assembled captains one last time before the march resumed at first light, but for now, he sought a moment of quiet. He found a secluded outcrop of rock, the wind cool on his face. He didn't pray in words, not anymore. He simply opened himself to the divine presence, feeling its steady, loving power flow through him, a silent communion that strengthened his resolve.

Tomorrow, they would bring Alanyi's light to Saltmere. Tomorrow, the first tithe of tears would be paid for a world reborn.
