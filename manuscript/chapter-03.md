### Chapter 3 – Shore of Second Chances

Grey dawn crept across the horizon, its pale fingers barely penetrating the heavy clouds that pressed down on the beach. Gond's eyes opened to cold, wet sand grinding against his cheek. His fingers still clutched a splintered driftwood plank, knuckles white and numb. Waves lapped at his legs with gentle mockery.

His body screamed as he pushed himself upright—muscles cramped from the swim, salt crusting his skin, lungs still raw from swallowing seawater. Nearby, Pell rolled onto his back with a weak laugh that turned into a coughing fit.

"That went exactly as planned," the rogue managed between spasms, spitting brine.

Further down the shore, Sim knelt with his palms pressed into the sand, lips moving in whispered prayer. His slender frame trembled—whether from cold or exhaustion, Gond couldn't tell.

Gond hauled himself to his feet, legs shaking. "Up." He extended a hand to Pell, then moved toward the priest. "Cold kills slower than slavers, but it still kills."

Sim looked up, offering a nod. "Inland. Freshwater." He pointed toward a gap in the dunes. "Fleabane and thrift cluster near streams—we can follow them to water."

Gond filed the information away. The priest's knowledge kept surprising him—not the mystical nonsense he'd expected, but practical survival skills. He scanned the debris littering the shore. Barrels bobbed in the shallows, tangled nets draped across rocks, planks scattered like broken bones.

He selected a warped boathook, testing its weight. Pell snatched up a coil of rope, fingers already working to untangle the knots. Sim gathered barnacle-crusted gourds, shaking each one near his ear before nodding approval.

They followed the thin trickle of freshwater inland, through a narrow gully where the stream broadened into clear, cold water. Pell dropped to his belly and drank like a man dying of thirst. Gond sipped carefully, eyes scanning the ridgelines above.

Sim crouched beside patches of sea-kale, showing Pell how to scrape salt crystals from the rocks. "For preserving meat," he explained, "when we find some."

The path climbed toward rugged cliffs, winding between wind-carved stones. At the crest stood a small hut, weathered grey as the morning sky. Smoke rose from its crooked chimney, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and herbs.

Before Gond could knock, the door swung open. An elderly woman stood in the threshold, spear held steady in capable hands. Her eyes swept over them—taking in their sodden clothes, makeshift weapons, the desperate edge that clung to escaped slaves.

"Names. Weapons down."

Gond lowered his staff. "Gond."

"Pell." The rope hit the ground.

"Sim." The priest spread his hands, empty palms facing outward. "We seek warmth and safety. No harm intended."

The woman's spear didn't waver. Her gaze lingered on each face, reading something in their expressions. Finally, she stepped aside. "One hour. No longer."

Warmth enveloped them as they entered. Herbs hung from the rafters, filling the air with the scent of thyme and sage. A small goat dozed in a woven basket near the fire, its breathing soft and even. The woman—Maera, she said—ladled steaming broth into wooden bowls.

Gond's hands shook as he lifted the bowl to his lips. The broth tasted of fish and wild onions, richer than any feast he could remember. Around him, Pell and Sim ate with the same desperate hunger, color returning to their faces.

Maera moved between them with efficient grace, binding Pell's bruised ribs with strips of clean cloth, examining Sim's blistered feet, cleaning the ugly brand on Gond's forehead with a pungent salve that made his eyes water.

"You're a healer?" Sim asked, watching her work.

"Served a temple in Darach once." Her voice carried the weight of old disappointments. "Corruption outweighed compassion." She glanced at the dagger Pell offered him. "Pacifist?"

Sim's hands remained folded in his lap. "My path is mercy. I heal and guide."

Pell snorted. "How's a pacifist supposed to defend himself from slave catchers? Pray them to death?"

Sim's eyes held steady calm. "Even the tiny field mouse will defend itself when attacked, and Alanyi blesses it."

Maera's weathered face showed the first hint of interest. "Then keep these two alive." The corner of her mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close.

Gond set down his empty bowl. "We're heading for Darach. Need information. Need..." His jaw tightened. "Justice."

Pell's eyes brightened at the mention of the city. "Streets full of opportunity. Coin changing hands."

"The old archives there," Sim added quietly. "They might hold answers about those who betrayed us."

Maera listened, her weathered face thoughtful. "There's a pilgrim way-station south of here." She sketched directions in the dirt floor with a charred stick. "Find supplies, rest. Perhaps clarity."

She pressed a satchel into Sim's hands—dried provisions and bundled herbs. "Compassion first," she said, meeting Gond's eyes. "Justice follows in its own time."

Outside, the wind had picked up, driving clouds across the grey sky. Gond adjusted his grip on the boathook, testing its balance. Behind them, the ocean whispered its endless secrets. Ahead lay Darach, uncertain and dangerous.

"We make an odd company," Pell observed, shouldering his rope.

"Odd, but perhaps balanced." Sim watched Gond carefully. "Sometimes the strangest alliances hold the strongest purpose."

The words settled into Gond's chest like stones dropped into still water. He looked at his companions—the warrior, the rogue, the priest. Three men with nothing in common but shared survival and the chains they'd broken.

He turned toward the inland path, feeling the weight of their trust like a physical burden. Behind them, the relentless ocean. Ahead, whatever waited in Darach.

Together, they stepped forward into the uncertain morning.
