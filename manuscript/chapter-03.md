### Chapter 3 – Shore of Second Chances

Grey dawn broke reluctantly, the soft glow barely piercing the heavy clouds that hung over the beach. Gond awoke first, face pressed against cold, wet sand, a splintered driftwood plank still gripped tightly in one numb hand. Waves lapped gently at his legs, mocking yet soothing at once.

He forced himself upright, body protesting with sharp, aching pains from the exhausting swim. Nearby, Pell stirred, groaning and spitting seawater, then rolling onto his back with a weak laugh. "That went exactly as planned," the rogue managed, coughing.

Sim knelt further down the shore, palms pressed into the sand, whispering earnest prayers of gratitude to Alanyi, his slender frame trembling visibly.

“Up,” Gond rasped, extending a shaking hand first to Pell, then moving toward Sim. “If the cold doesn't kill us, slavers certainly will.”

Sim looked up, offering Gond a quiet, grateful nod. “Inland for freshwater. Look for fleabane or thrift; they cluster near streams,” he advised softly, voice steady despite the ordeal.

Gond stored the knowledge away, impressed again by Sim’s unexpected practicality. Scanning the beach, Gond quickly assessed their resources. Debris littered the shore—barrels, tangled nets, shattered planks. He selected a warped boathook for himself; Pell, ever resourceful, snatched a coil of rope. Sim gathered gourds encrusted with barnacles, shaking them carefully to ensure they held no leaks.

Together, the trio moved inland through a narrow gully, following a thin trickle of freshwater that soon broadened into a clear, cool stream. Pell drank greedily, while Gond carefully sipped, watchful and wary. Sim pointed out edible sea-kale and patiently showed Pell how to scrape useful salt crystals from rocks for later preservation.

Their strength somewhat restored, the companions ascended a narrow, winding path that climbed toward rugged cliffs. At its crest stood a small stone hut, modest and weathered, smoke rising invitingly from a crooked chimney. The scent of woodsmoke and herbs drew them forward with irresistible warmth.

Before Gond could knock, the door swung open abruptly, revealing an elderly woman holding a spear steady in capable hands. Her flinty eyes assessed them rapidly.

“Names. Weapons down,” she commanded firmly.

“Gond,” the mercenary responded, lowering his makeshift staff.

“Pell,” the rogue added, dropping the rope without hesitation.

“Sim, servant of Alanyi,” the priest finished gently, hands spread openly in peace. “We seek warmth, safety—no harm intended.”

The woman considered this briefly, spear unwavering, then nodded sharply. “You may enter. One hour. No longer.”

Inside, warmth and simple comfort greeted them. Herbs hung drying from the rafters, scenting the air. A small goat slept contentedly in a woven basket near the fire. The woman, introducing herself as Maera, served bowls of steaming broth that tasted richer and more satisfying than any feast Gond had known.

As they ate gratefully, Maera tended to their wounds efficiently—binding Pell’s bruised ribs, inspecting Sim’s blistered feet, and carefully treating the ugly brand on Gond’s forehead with a pungent, soothing salve.

"You're a healer?" Sim asked quietly, curious yet respectful.

“Once served a temple in Darach,” Maera replied tersely, “but corruption outweighed compassion.” She eyed Sim appraisingly, noting his refusal of a dagger offered by Pell. "Pacifist?"

Sim nodded gently. "My path is mercy. I heal and guide."

"Then keep these two alive," she instructed, her voice edged with humor.

Their discussion soon turned to next steps. Gond expressed determination to head for Darach, driven by the need for information and revenge. Pell’s eyes gleamed at the thought of bustling streets and opportunities for coin. Sim quietly mentioned the Alanyite shrine there, hinting its archives might reveal crucial details about their betrayers.

Maera listened, eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “There’s a pilgrim way-station south,” she finally offered, providing directions. "Find supplies there, rest, and perhaps clarity."

Grateful for her aid, the trio prepared to depart, Maera pressing a satchel of herbs and dried provisions into Sim’s hands. “Compassion first,” she murmured solemnly, meeting Gond's gaze meaningfully. "Justice will follow in due course."

Setting out beneath windswept skies, Gond considered their strange alliance—the warrior, the rogue, and the priest. Pell voiced the thought aloud with amusement, “We make an odd company indeed.”

“Odd, but perhaps balanced,” Sim replied thoughtfully, watching Gond carefully. “Sometimes the strangest alliances hold the strongest purpose.”

The words resonated deeply with Gond, touching something raw within him. He adjusted his grip on the boathook, feeling not just anger but now something subtler—responsibility.

Behind them, the relentless ocean whispered its secrets. Ahead lay Darach, uncertain yet beckoning. Together, they stepped forward, bound by shared survival, wary trust, and a fledgling hope neither had yet fully named.
