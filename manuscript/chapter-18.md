# Paladin's Rise

## Part IV: Forging a Free Nation

### Chapter 18: First Stand

The messenger stumbled into the valley at dawn, his horse lathered with sweat and foam. Pell caught the man as he slid from the saddle, legs buckling beneath him.

"Three columns," the scout gasped, clutching Pell's arm. "Coming from the east. Maybe two hundred men. They march in perfect formation—shields locked, spears angled at identical degrees, no stragglers or wanderers. These aren't slavers grabbing easy prey."

Gond emerged from the council tent, Thorek and Elena flanking him. The dwarf's hand rested on his warhammer, while Elena's fingers drummed against her sword hilt.

"How far?" Gond asked.

"Half a day's march. They'll be here by midday." The messenger's eyes darted around the bustling settlement. "They've got siege ladders. Crossbow companies. This isn't a raid—it's an assault."

Thorek spat into the dirt. "About time. Been wondering when they'd stop sending amateurs."

Elena studied the eastern ridge line. "Two hundred professional soldiers. That's a significant investment. Someone wants you badly enough to hire an army."

Gond's jaw tightened. The settlement had grown to nearly three hundred souls, but barely half were fighters. The rest were refugees, children, elderly—people who'd come seeking sanctuary, not war.

"Grimjaw!" he called.

The massive dwarf emerged from behind his siege engine, bronze-reinforced and gleaming in the morning light. Gold teeth flashed in his beard as he grinned. "Aye, lad? Time to test the old girl?"

"Three columns, professional soldiers. Can your engine cover the eastern approach?"

Grimjaw's grin widened. "Cover it? I can turn it into a firey graveyard. Just give me targets."

Thorek nodded approvingly. "The engine's positioned well. Overlapping fields of fire with the crossbow positions. But two hundred soldiers..." He stroked his braided beard. "We'll need every advantage."

Elena pointed to the settlement's layout. "They'll expect desperate refugees hiding behind makeshift walls. Instead, they'll find prepared positions and coordinated defense."

Gond surveyed his people as they began their preparations. Sim moved among the fighters, checking wounds from previous skirmishes. Silviana stood near the ancient oak, her hands pressed against its bark, lips moving in silent prayer. Aerin and Dax helped distribute bolts and arrows, their faces grim but determined.

"Pell, take twenty of our best and position them in the rocks above the eastern pass. Let the first column through, then hit them from behind."

Pell nodded, already selecting his team with quick gestures.

"Elena, coordinate the crossbow companies. Staggered volleys, maximum disruption."

"Understood."

"Thorek, you and I will hold the center with the main force. When they commit to the assault, we counterattack."

The dwarf's eyes gleamed. "Like the old days, when Turin and Alanyi fought side by side."

Heat bloomed beneath Gond's ribs, spreading outward like molten honey through his veins. His fingertips tingled with electric warmth as divine power stirred in response to the coming battle. "Let's hope we're worthy of that legacy."

***

The enemy appeared at the ridge line precisely at midday, their armor glinting in the sun. Three columns, just as the scout had reported, moving with the disciplined precision of professional soldiers. No banners, no identifying marks—mercenaries hired for a specific job.

Gond crouched behind the settlement's reinforced palisade, watching through a gap between logs. The lead column carried siege ladders and grappling hooks. The second bristled with crossbows. The third held back in reserve, their captain scanning the valley with a spyglass.

"Smart," Elena murmured beside him. "They're not underestimating us."

The enemy captain lowered his spyglass and raised his hand. Horns sounded across the valley, their notes echoing off the surrounding hills.

"Here they come," Thorek growled.

The first column advanced down the slope, shields locked, ladders ready. Behind them, crossbowmen took position on the ridge, their weapons trained on the settlement's walls.

Gond waited until the attackers reached the valley floor. "Grimjaw! Give them a welcome!"

The siege engine's massive frame groaned as the windlass released. The throwing arm snapped forward with a sound like thunder, counterweight stones plummeting in their mesh of chains. A rain of small boulders, soaked in pitch and set alight, crashed into the center of the advancing column. Bodies fell under the onslaught, and burning pitch splashed in a large radius. The neat formation dissolved into chaos.

"Again!" Grimjaw roared, his crew already cranking the windlass system, their muscles straining against the massive mechanism.

The second shot scattered the crossbowmen on the ridge. The third punched through the enemy's shield wall, leaving a gap filled with screaming wounded.

But the professionals adapted quickly. The remaining soldiers spread out, using the terrain for cover. Crossbow bolts began raining down on the settlement, forcing defenders to duck behind their walls.

"They're flanking left!" Elena called out.

A group of soldiers had broken away from the main assault, moving toward the settlement's weakest point. Gond saw their plan—pin the defenders with frontal assault while a strike team breached the walls.

"Silviana!" he shouted.

The elf appeared at his side, her eyes bright with power. "I see them."

She raised her hands, and the very air seemed to shimmer. The flanking soldiers stumbled, their formation wavering as confusion took hold. Some turned back toward their own lines, others stood frozen in place.

"Elven magic," Thorek muttered appreciatively. "Haven't seen that in decades."

But the enemy captain was no fool. He'd held his reserve for exactly this moment. Fresh soldiers poured down the slope, overwhelming Pell's position in the rocks. Gond watched his friend's team fall back, fighting desperately against superior numbers.

"They're breaking through!" someone shouted.

The settlement's eastern wall shuddered under the impact of grappling hooks and ladders. Defenders rushed to meet the assault, but the enemy had momentum now.

The warmth in Gond's chest suddenly blazed like a forge fire, power coursing through his muscles until they hummed with divine strength. His sword erupted in silver light as he vaulted over the palisade.

"For freedom!" he roared.

The cry was taken up by every throat in the settlement. Thorek's warhammer sang through the air, crushing skulls and shattering shields. Elena's blade danced like quicksilver, finding gaps in armor with surgical precision.

But it was Gond who turned the tide. Divine power flowed through him like molten gold, enhancing his speed, his strength, his awareness. He moved through the enemy ranks with fluid grace, his blazing sword cutting down anyone who stood against him. Each strike flowed into the next, his feet finding perfect footing on treacherous ground while his blade danced between opponents.

A crossbow bolt took him in the shoulder, spinning him around. Another grazed his thigh. But the wounds closed almost as quickly as they opened, divine healing knitting flesh and bone.

The enemy soldiers began to falter. They'd come expecting to fight desperate refugees, not a paladin of Alanyi backed by dwarven siege engines and elven magic.

"Fall back!" their captain shouted. "Regroup on the ridge!"

But Gond wasn't finished. He pressed the attack, leading his fighters up the slope in a devastating countercharge. The enemy broke and ran, leaving their dead scattered across the valley floor.

***

The sun was setting by the time they finished counting the cost. Forty-three enemy dead, the rest fled into the hills. But victory had come at a price.

Gond knelt beside Sif's body, the young man's face peaceful in death. A crossbow bolt had taken him through the heart during the final charge. Beside him lay Marta, an elderly woman who'd joined them only weeks ago. A sword thrust had ended her life as she tried to protect the children.

Seven dead. Nineteen wounded. The settlement's first major battle had been won, but the price was written in blood and tears.

"They fought well," Thorek said quietly. "Died with honor."

Sim moved among the wounded, his hands glowing with gentle light as he channeled Alanyi's healing power. But even divine magic couldn't bring back the dead.

Silviana approached, her face grave. "The enemy will return. This was a test, nothing more."

Elena nodded. "They'll report our capabilities, our numbers. Next time they'll come with more soldiers, better tactics."

Gond stood slowly, his shoulder still aching despite the healing. "Then we'd better be ready."

He looked around at his people—human, dwarf, and elf standing together in the gathering darkness. They'd faced their first real test and emerged victorious, but the cost had been higher than he'd hoped.

"We'll honor our dead," he said, his voice carrying across the settlement. "And we'll remember why they died. Not for conquest or glory, but for the simple right to be free."

Pell limped up beside him, a bandage wrapped around his head. "The scouts are reporting movement to the south. Looks like word is spreading."

"Good," Gond replied. "Let them come. We'll be ready."

But as he watched the funeral pyres being lit, he wondered how many more would die before their war was won. The path to freedom was paved with sacrifice, and he was beginning to understand the true weight of leadership.

The divine power still hummed in his veins, but it felt different now—heavier, more solemn. With each life lost, each victory won, he was becoming something more than just a reluctant paladin.

He was becoming a leader worthy of the cause he served.

***

Later that night, as the settlement settled into uneasy sleep, Gond stood watch on the eastern wall. The enemy dead had been stripped of weapons and armor, their bodies left for the carrion birds. It was harsh, but they couldn't spare the effort to bury soldiers who'd come to enslave them.

Thorek joined him, the dwarf's armor still stained with blood.

"First real battle's always the hardest," the war-priest said. "You did well, lad. Your people fought like lions."

"Seven dead," Gond replied. "Seven people who trusted me to keep them safe."

"Aye. And how many more would have died if you'd done nothing? How many slaves would still be in chains?" Thorek's voice was gentle but firm. "Leadership means making hard choices. The dead knew the risks."

Gond nodded, but the weight in his chest didn't ease. "The enemy captain was good. Professional. This wasn't some slaver raid—someone hired real soldiers."

"The slave cities are taking notice. Your little rebellion is becoming a real threat." Thorek grinned fiercely. "About time."

A commotion near the settlement's center drew their attention. Maera was approaching with a small group of riders, their horses steaming in the cool night air.

"More refugees?" Gond asked.

"No," Thorek said, studying the newcomers. "Those are soldiers. Look at how they sit their horses, how they scan for threats."

Gond climbed down from the wall, Thorek beside him. As they approached the group, he could see the dwarf was right. These weren't desperate refugees—they were fighters, and well-equipped ones at that.

The lead rider dismounted, removing his helm to reveal a weathered face and graying hair. His armor bore the crossed hammers of Turin's order, but with subtle differences that marked him as Iron Covenant.

"Battlemaster Korgan Ironshield," the dwarf announced formally. "I bring word from the Iron Covenant's high council."

Thorek stepped forward, offering a warrior's salute. "Brother. What news?"

Korgan's expression was grim. "The slave cities have formed an alliance. Five major ports, pooling their resources. They're raising an army—not mercenaries this time, but their own soldiers. Professional troops with siege engines and cavalry."

Gond felt his stomach tighten. "How many?"

"Two thousand men, maybe more. They'll march within the month."

The number hung in the air like a death sentence. Two thousand professional soldiers against their three hundred fighters, half of whom were barely trained refugees.

"There's more," Korgan continued. "The religious orders are splitting. Some support you, others call you a heretic. It's chaos in the temples."

Silviana emerged from the shadows, her elven features sharp in the moonlight. "The Circle of Whispers has been watching these developments. We may have allies you don't expect."

"Elves?" Gond asked.

"Among others. The old alliances are stirring, the bonds forged when Turin and Alanyi first stood together against darkness." Her eyes met his. "But it will take time to organize such support."

"Time we may not have," Elena said, joining the group. "Two thousand soldiers could be here in weeks."

Gond looked around at the faces surrounding him—dwarf, elf, and human united in common cause. The settlement's first victory had proven they could fight, but the real war was just beginning.

"Then we'll make time," Gond said, his voice carrying an authority that seemed to come from somewhere beyond himself. The words flowed with divine certainty, each syllable ringing with conviction. "We'll hit their caravans and attack their supply chains. Every slave caravan we liberate strengthens our cause and weakens them."

That was not what Gond had planned to say. His own surprise was mirrored in the faces around him, but Gond had learned not to question when his goddess chose to speak through him.

"Until now we've been on the defensive. Now it's time to take the fight to the slavers. We'll catch them off guard and buy the time we need to prepare."

The others stared at him with expressions caught between awe and reverence, their eyes reflecting something in him that he could not feel himself. Then Silviana gave a little shake of her head, nodded slowly, and started discussing the new plans with Thorek and the others. This seemed to break the spell, and everyone started to move with renewed purpose.

As the group dispersed to spread the word, Gond remained standing in the settlement's center. The funeral pyres had burned down to glowing embers, but their light still flickered in the darkness.

Seven dead today. How many more before this was over?

But as he looked around at the settlement—at the workshops where weapons were forged, the training grounds where refugees learned to fight, the council area where former slaves planned their own liberation—he felt something he hadn't expected.

Hope.

They'd faced professional soldiers and won. They'd proven that free people fighting for their homes could stand against any army. And now, with allies gathering from across the continent, they might actually have a chance.

Paladin's Rise was gone, burned away in the fires of battle. In his place stood something new—a leader ready to forge a free nation from the ashes of the old world.
