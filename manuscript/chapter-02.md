### Chapter 2: Breaking Chains

The ship's hull groaned like an old man's bones, each creak marking time in their floating prison. Gond's skull still felt like someone had used it for hammer practice, but the initial fog had lifted enough for him to think clearly. Around him, the symphony of misery played on—retching, whimpering, the constant rattle of chains.

His tongue moved across cracked lips, tasting the metallic tang that lingered from whatever they'd used to drug him. *Badger's bladder would taste better,* he thought, forcing himself to swallow the foul water when it came.

Days crawled by. Gond ate the slop they tossed down, drank the brackish water, and watched. Always watching. The guards grew lazier with each passing day, their routines as predictable as sunrise.

Jord shifted beside him for the hundredth time, chains clanking. The man's shoulders bunched like a bull ready to charge, and his breathing came fast and shallow. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold.

"You bolt too early, we're all feeding the fish," Gond murmured, not looking at him.

Jord's jaw worked silently, but he managed a jerky nod.

Behind them, Pell watched everything with eyes like a hawk tracking prey. His head turned at every footstep above, every change in the guards' voices. When he caught Gond's attention, he tilted his chin toward the hatch.

"One of them keeps leaning too far over," Pell whispered. "The greasy one with the gap teeth. Likes to wave his food around, make us watch him eat."

Gond had noticed. The guard thought himself clever, dangling strips of dried meat just out of reach while prisoners strained against their chains.

"We wait for his shift," Gond said.

The man chained with Pell—Sim—kept his voice soft as morning mist. "Patience will serve us better than haste." Even here, in this floating tomb, something in his tone made the nearby prisoners lean closer, tension easing from their shoulders.

"Keep your god handy," Jord muttered. "We'll need more than pretty words."

Sim's mouth curved in the faintest smile. "She's always listening."

The moment came three nights later. Greasy leaned far into the hold, waving a strip of salted pork just beyond Gond's reach. "Hungry, are we? Maybe if you bark like a proper dog—"

Gond's hand shot up, fingers closing on the guard's rough tunic. One sharp yank, and Greasy pitched forward with a satisfying crack as his skull met oak planking.

"Now!"

Pell moved like water, flowing over Greasy's prone form to snatch keys and shortsword. Steel flashed as he freed himself, then tossed the keys to Sim, who caught them without looking up from his quiet prayers.

"Wait—" Gond started, but Jord's patience shattered like dropped glass.

The big man roared and charged upward, chains trailing behind him like anchor rope. Shouts erupted from above.

"Bloody fool!" Gond snarled, racing after him.

The deck exploded into chaos. Guards stumbled from their dice games, fumbling for weapons. Gond's blade found the gap between one man's ribs before the guard could clear his scabbard. The man folded over, hands clutching his throat as he toppled into the rail.

"Over the side!" Gond shouted over the rising din.

Pell appeared at his shoulder, his knife work quick and merciless. Prisoners poured from below like water through a broken dam, some still trailing chains, all desperate.

A crossbow string sang. Jord jerked, the bolt sprouting from his chest like a deadly flower. His eyes went wide, not with pain but with understanding. He lurched toward Gond, fingers grasping.

Gond brought his blade down on Jord's wrist. The steel bit deep, and the drowning man's grip loosened. Gond's dagger tumbled away into darkness as he vaulted the rail.

Cold water hit him like a physical blow, driving the air from his lungs. Around him, other bodies splashed into the waves. Some went under immediately, dragged down by iron weights. Others surfaced, gasping and flailing.

Gond's head broke the surface. Twenty yards away, Pell and Sim swam with steady strokes, still chained together but moving as if they'd practiced the maneuver. Their coordination spoke of quick thinking and natural teamwork.

The shore seemed impossibly distant, but Gond forced his aching arms to move. Stroke after stroke, breath after ragged breath, until his knees scraped sand and he could crawl onto the beach.

He collapsed face-first into wet sand, lungs burning, every muscle screaming. Nearby, Pell rolled onto his back and actually laughed—a breathless, disbelieving sound.

"Well," the rogue gasped, "that went exactly as planned."

Sim knelt further up the beach, his lips moving in what looked like prayers of gratitude. His shoulders shook, though whether from cold or relief, Gond couldn't tell.

Hours later, after Pell had produced a rusty file from somewhere in his rags and they'd worked their wrists raw removing the manacles, Gond stood and brushed sand from his clothes. Inland, smoke rose from a small chimney, promising warmth and perhaps answers.

He looked at his unlikely companions—the sharp-eyed thief and the gentle priest—and felt something shift in his chest. Not quite trust, but maybe its distant cousin.

"Come on," he said, shouldering his makeshift pack. "Our path lies ahead."
