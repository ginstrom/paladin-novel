### Chapter 2: Breaking Chains

The ship's hull groaned like an old man's bones, each creak marking time in their floating prison. Gond's skull still felt like someone had used it for hammer practice, but the initial fog had lifted enough for him to think clearly. Around him, the symphony of misery played on—retching, whimpering, the constant rattle of chains.

His tongue moved across cracked lips, tasting the metallic tang that lingered from whatever they'd used to drug him. *Badger's bladder would taste better,* he thought, forcing himself to swallow the foul water when it came.

Days crawled by. Gond ate the slop they tossed down, drank the brackish water, and watched. Always watching. The guards grew lazier with each passing day, their routines as predictable as sunrise.

Jord shifted beside him for the hundredth time, chains clanking. The man's shoulders bunched like a bull ready to charge, and his breathing came fast and shallow. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the cold.

"You bolt too early, we're all feeding the fish," Gond murmured, not looking at him.

Jord's jaw worked silently, but he managed a jerky nod.

Behind them, Pell watched everything with eyes like a hawk tracking prey. His head turned at every footstep above, every change in the guards' voices. When he caught Gond's attention, he tilted his chin toward the hatch.

"One of them keeps leaning too far over," Pell whispered. "The greasy one with the gap teeth. Likes to wave his food around, make us watch him eat."

Gond had noticed. The guard thought himself clever, dangling strips of dried meat just out of reach while prisoners strained against their chains.

"We wait for his shift," Gond said.

The man chained with Pell—Sim—kept his voice soft as morning mist. "Patience will serve us better than haste." Even here, in this floating tomb, something in his tone made the nearby prisoners lean closer, tension easing from their shoulders.

"Keep your god handy," Jord muttered. "We'll need more than pretty words."

Sim's mouth curved in the faintest smile. "She's always listening."

The planning began in earnest the next night, when the guards settled into their dice games and the hold fell into restless quiet. Gond shifted closer to his companions, chains scraping against wood.

"Listen carefully," he breathed, his voice barely audible above the ship's creaking. "We get one chance at this."

Jord's muscles coiled like springs. His fingers drummed against his thigh in rapid, nervous beats. "Just give the word. I'm ready to—"

"You're ready to get us all killed," Gond cut him off. "Greasy leans over the hatch every third watch. Always the same spot, always showing off his food."

Pell's eyes glittered in the dim light filtering down from above. "Twelve steps from hatch to rail on the port side. I counted. But there's a coil of rope near the mainmast—could trip a man in the dark."

"Good." Gond's mind worked through the sequence like a chess master planning moves. "Sim, how fast can you free yourself once you have keys?"

"Thirty heartbeats, perhaps forty." The priest's voice carried quiet certainty. "These locks are crude. But the others..." He gestured toward the rows of chained prisoners.

"We can't save them all," Gond said, the words tasting like ash. "Not this time."

Jord's breathing quickened. His shoulders hunched forward, every line of his body screaming impatience. "So we just leave them? Let them rot while we—"

"We survive," Gond said firmly. "Dead heroes save no one."

Pell leaned closer, his voice like silk over steel. "The crossbow guard—he's left-handed, favors his weak side when he draws. If we can get him to turn..."

"I'll handle the crossbow," Gond said. "Pell, you get the keys and free Sim. Jord—"

"I know what I'm doing," Jord growled, his fists clenching and unclenching in steady rhythm.

"Do you?" Gond's stare could have cut glass. "Because the moment you charge up those stairs screaming like a berserker, every guard on this ship knows exactly where we are."

Sim placed a gentle hand on Jord's arm. The big man's breathing slowed slightly, though his muscles remained taut as bowstrings. "The river finds its way to the sea not through force, but through persistence," the priest murmured.

"Pretty words won't stop a crossbow bolt," Jord muttered, but some of the tension left his shoulders.

Gond studied each face in turn. "Pell—you're sure about the rope?"

"Port side, three feet from the mast. Thick as a man's wrist." Pell's fingers moved in small, precise gestures, mapping the deck from memory. "But if we go starboard instead..."

"Longer run to the rail. More time for them to organize." Gond shook his head. "We stick with port side. Jord, you follow my lead. No charging, no roaring. We move fast but quiet until we're committed."

"And if it goes wrong?" Jord asked.

Sim's smile was serene as dawn light. "Then we trust that Alanyi guides our path, whatever it may be."

"Trust the goddess, but swim like your life depends on it," Pell added with dark humor.

Gond felt the weight of their lives settling on his shoulders. Three men, bound by nothing but shared desperation and the chains that held them. In a few hours, they would either be free or dead.

"Remember," he whispered, "Greasy leans over at the start of third watch. We take him quiet, get the keys, and move. No hesitation, no second thoughts."

Jord's jaw worked silently, but he nodded. Pell's eyes never stopped moving, cataloging every shadow and sound. Sim's lips moved in what might have been prayer or simply preparation.

The die was cast. Now they could only wait for the moment to strike.

***

The moment came three nights later. Greasy leaned far into the hold, waving a strip of salted pork just beyond Gond's reach. "Hungry, are we? Maybe if you bark like a proper dog—"

Gond's hand shot up, fingers closing on the guard's rough tunic. One sharp yank, and Greasy pitched forward with a satisfying crack as his skull met oak planking.

"Now!"

Pell moved like water, flowing over Greasy's prone form to snatch keys and shortsword. Steel flashed as he freed himself, then tossed the keys to Sim, who caught them without looking up from his quiet prayers.

"Wait—" Gond started, but Jord's patience shattered like dropped glass.

The big man roared and charged upward, chains trailing behind him like anchor rope. Shouts erupted from above.

"Bloody fool!" Gond snarled, racing after him.

The deck exploded into chaos. Guards stumbled from their dice games, fumbling for weapons. Gond's blade found the gap between one man's ribs before the guard could clear his scabbard. The man folded over, hands clutching his throat as he toppled into the rail.

"Over the side!" Gond shouted over the rising din.

Pell appeared at his shoulder, his knife work quick and merciless. Prisoners poured from below like water through a broken dam, some still trailing chains, all desperate.

A crossbow string sang. Jord jerked, the bolt sprouting from his chest like a deadly flower. His eyes went wide, not with pain but with understanding. He lurched toward Gond, fingers grasping.

Gond brought his blade down on Jord's wrist. The steel bit deep, and the drowning man's grip loosened. Gond's dagger tumbled away into darkness as he vaulted the rail.

Cold water hit him like a physical blow, driving the air from his lungs. Around him, other bodies splashed into the waves. Some went under immediately, dragged down by iron weights. Others surfaced, gasping and flailing.

Gond's head broke the surface. Twenty yards away, Pell and Sim swam with steady strokes, still chained together but moving as if they'd practiced the maneuver. Their coordination spoke of quick thinking and natural teamwork.

The shore seemed impossibly distant, but Gond forced his aching arms to move. Stroke after stroke, breath after ragged breath, until his knees scraped sand and he could crawl onto the beach.

He collapsed face-first into wet sand, lungs burning, every muscle screaming. Nearby, Pell rolled onto his back and actually laughed—a breathless, disbelieving sound.

"Well," the rogue gasped, "that went exactly as planned."

Sim knelt further up the beach, his lips moving in what looked like prayers of gratitude. His shoulders shook, though whether from cold or relief, Gond couldn't tell.

***

Hours later, Pell produced a rusty file from somewhere in his rags. The metal scraped against iron with agonizing slowness, each stroke sending vibrations through already raw wrists. Gond's hands shook uncontrollably—not from effort, but from the bone-deep cold that had settled into his marrow. His lips had turned blue, and his breath came in short, visible puffs despite the mild coastal air.

"Hold still," Pell muttered through chattering teeth, his own fingers fumbling with the file. Dark humor crept into his voice even as his hands trembled. "At this rate, we'll die of old age before these bloody things come off. Though I suppose that's better than drowning."

Sim worked at his own manacles with methodical patience, but Gond could see the priest's shoulders hunched against more than just the cold. The weight of Jord's death pressed down on all of them—the big man's final, desperate reach, the sound of steel biting through bone and sinew.

Gond's stomach cramped violently, and he doubled over, retching seawater and bile onto the sand. The taste of salt and copper filled his mouth, remnants of the ship's foul water mixed with his own blood from where he'd bitten his tongue during the swim. Each heave sent spasms through his already aching ribs.

"Easy," Sim said quietly, moving closer despite his own chains. The priest's voice carried that same steady calm, but his movements were careful, deliberate—the actions of a man fighting his own demons. "The body needs time to expel what doesn't belong."

When the retching finally stopped, Gond found Sim kneeling beside him with strips of torn cloth. The priest's gentle hands cleaned the raw, bleeding wounds where the manacles had chafed, then bound them with surprising skill. His touch was warm against Gond's ice-cold skin.

"There," Sim murmured, tying off the makeshift bandages. "The healing will come in time."

Pell finally worked his own chains free and immediately set to helping the others, his usual quick wit subdued. "Well," he said, forcing lightness into his voice, "at least we're not fish food. Though I'm starting to think the fish might have had the easier time of it."

The joke fell flat in the grey morning air, but it served its purpose—a reminder that they were alive, that survival meant moving forward despite the weight of what they'd lost.

***

When the last manacle finally fell away, Gond stood and brushed sand from his clothes. His legs still shook, and the world tilted slightly with each movement, but he forced himself upright. Inland, smoke rose from a small chimney, promising warmth and perhaps answers.

He looked at his unlikely companions—the sharp-eyed thief and the gentle priest—and felt something shift in his chest. Not quite trust, but maybe its distant cousin. They had bled together, suffered together, lost a friend together. That had to count for something.

"Come on," he said, shouldering his makeshift pack. "Our path lies ahead."
