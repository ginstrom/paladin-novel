### Chapter 2: Breaking Chains

The world resolved itself into a symphony of misery, played on an orchestra of groaning wood and creaking rope. Gond’s head still felt like a blacksmith was using it for anvil practice, but the initial fog of betrayal and the searing shock of the brand had receded enough for a grim clarity to take its place. He was on a ship, that much was certain. The gentle, sickening sway, the rhythmic slap of water against the hull, and the unique bouquet of bilge, unwashed bodies, and despair were unmistakable. *Home sweet home,* he thought, the sarcasm bitter on his tongue, which still felt like a sand-dried badger.

Days blurred into a monotonous cycle of near-starvation, thirst, and ever-present stench. Gond hoarded his strength, forcing himself to eat the foul slop and drink brackish water. He watched, listened, planned. The chains that linked him to Jord—a hot-headed thug whose impulsive nature constantly threatened to sabotage everything—rattled ominously whenever Jord shifted restlessly.

“You move before we’re ready, and we all end up shark food,” Gond warned quietly.

Jord growled but grudgingly nodded, forced into momentary submission by Gond's sheer force of will. Directly behind them were Pell and Sim, chained together yet distinctly different. Pell, lean and sharp-eyed, was perpetually alert, his calculating gaze assessing every possible advantage. Sim, gentle and serene even in these grim circumstances, whispered soft prayers of comfort and courage to those nearby, his quiet faith a soothing balm against the pervasive despair.

The pair chained ahead of Gond were little more than ghosts already, eyes hollow and bodies slack. No help there.

Pell leaned forward one night, voice low and urgent. "I've noticed the guard shifts are sloppy. Greasy’s especially careless."

Gond nodded. "Agreed. We wait for his shift—he's our weak link."

Sim’s quiet voice joined them, “Patience and timing will see us free. We must act together, as one.”

"Just keep your god on standby," Jord grumbled. "We'll need more than prayers."

Sim merely smiled, unruffled. "Alanyi will guide us."

Opportunity finally presented itself. Greasy leaned dangerously far into the hold, taunting prisoners with strips of dried meat. Gond moved decisively. His freed hand shot forward, grabbing Greasy’s tunic, pulling him headfirst into the hold. A satisfying crack echoed as the guard’s skull met oak.

"Now!" Gond hissed.

Pell surged forward instantly, grabbing Greasy's shortsword and keys with catlike grace. He freed himself swiftly, throwing the keys to Sim, who efficiently began unlocking chains, steady prayers on his lips.

"Hold!" Gond cautioned Jord, whose patience was fraying visibly. But the thug's nerve snapped prematurely. He roared and bolted upwards, attracting instant attention.

"Fool!" Gond cursed, racing after him.

Bursting onto the deck, Gond was met with chaos. Guards scrambled, fumbling for weapons. Gond charged, his mercenary instincts guiding his blade true. One guard collapsed, throat cut between hatch and rail.

"Over the side, now!" Gond commanded, adrenaline sharpening his voice.

Pell appeared at his side, defending their flank with ruthless precision. Prisoners erupted from below, chains clattering, confusion reigning. Jord lunged recklessly at a guard, buying Gond and Pell crucial seconds.

Gond vaulted over the rail, plunging into the icy shock of seawater. Others followed, some dragged under by their chains. Jord, hit by a crossbow bolt, grasped Gond desperately, panic in his dying eyes. Gond hacked brutally at Jord’s wrist, freeing himself just as his dagger slipped from his grasp, spiraling into darkness.

Surfacing gasping, Gond saw Pell and Sim swimming strongly, their teamwork evident even chained together. After an exhausting swim, they reached the shore, collapsing onto the sand, trembling with cold and exertion.

Pell, grinning triumphantly, held up a rusty file. "Rogue’s luck," he quipped breathlessly. Hours later, the manacles finally fell away.

Inland, a herbalist's hut loomed invitingly against the horizon. Gond stood, resolve tightening his jaw.

"Come," he urged Pell and Sim, forming an unlikely yet formidable trio. "Our path lies ahead."
