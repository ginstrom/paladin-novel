### Chapter 10: Whispers in Stone

A soft drizzle whispered through the mist-laden hills, draping the landscape in ghostly gray as Gond's weary band pushed deeper inland. Gond, walking at the forefront, felt the sting of fatigue gnawing at his bones. Behind him trudged Pell, ever watchful; Sim, his gentle presence an anchor to the group's fading morale; and the trio of rescued captives—Aerin, Dax, and Lira—each bearing their own burdens with quiet dignity.

"Sim," Gond called softly, slowing his stride, "you’ve been mumbling prayers since dawn. Do your gods offer any navigational advice, or is that extra?"

Sim smiled faintly, unfazed by Gond's irreverence. "Alanyi guides the heart more clearly than the feet. But perhaps she smiles upon us after all. Look there."

He gestured ahead, where through swirling mist emerged the pale silhouette of stone ruins, partially concealed by climbing ivy and thick moss. Gond felt a strange tug in his chest, the kind he'd learned not to dismiss. "Your goddess has strange tastes," he muttered dryly.

The priest's serene gaze lingered on the ancient stones. "This was a sanctuary of Alanyi," Sim explained quietly. "Once, such temples stood throughout the land. Now they crumble, forgotten or mocked."

"Perfect," Pell grumbled, warily scanning the surroundings. "We'll blend right in."

Ignoring Pell's grumbles, Gond approached the ruins. The stones, worn and weathered, carried faded carvings—symbols of peace and intertwined hands long eroded by time and neglect. He touched one carving lightly, the damp stone cold beneath his fingertips. It felt oddly comforting.

"We can shelter here tonight," Gond decided, forcing authority into his tired voice. "Sim, do you think Alanyi minds squatters?"

Sim shook his head gently, eyes alight with a faint humor. "She welcomes all who seek refuge. Even the irreverent."

The companions moved quickly, establishing a camp within the temple's crumbling walls. Soon, a small fire crackled, casting flickering shadows across the ancient sanctuary. Dax's injured feet were tended gently by Sim, while Aerin and Lira prepared a modest meal from gathered wild herbs and roots.

As night fell, Gond found himself restlessly wandering deeper into the ruins, drawn by an inexplicable compulsion. His footsteps echoed faintly as he navigated half-collapsed archways, until he reached a quiet chamber, surprisingly intact. Here, stone benches surrounded an altar, smooth from countless years of reverent hands.

He paused, a sense of calm washing unexpectedly over him. A quiet hum, barely audible, vibrated softly in the air. Gond felt his pulse quicken, a gentle yet insistent pressure behind his eyes. He touched the altar almost unconsciously.

A sudden warmth surged through him, disorienting and profound. Gond's vision blurred, shifting into something clearer, sharper. He saw images—brief flashes of battles and peaceful gatherings, lives saved, lives lost, and amid it all, a figure cloaked in gentle, radiant light. A woman’s voice, impossibly tender yet firm, whispered in his ear: "You carry burdens willingly, Gond. Now carry hope."

The vision faded, leaving Gond breathless, trembling. The stone beneath his palm was now merely cold stone again, yet the warmth inside him lingered, potent and unsettling.

He staggered slightly, sitting heavily upon the nearest bench. His thoughts raced, heart hammering with uncertainty. Was this madness or something far stranger? Gond clenched his jaw tightly, deciding swiftly. For now, silence was best. He would puzzle out this revelation alone.

Returning to the main camp, Gond felt Sim's quiet eyes upon him, deep with knowing curiosity. The priest merely nodded, unspoken understanding between them.

That night, sleep eluded Gond, leaving him staring up at the fractured ceiling, where stars shone softly through cracks. For the first time in his life, he sensed a path opening before him—one he hadn’t chosen, yet felt compelled to follow. Around him lay those who had somehow become his responsibility, their gentle breathing a stark reminder of his burdens.

"Hope," Gond murmured bitterly to himself, almost smiling in the darkness. "Well, Alanyi, let’s see if you’ve chosen the right fool."
