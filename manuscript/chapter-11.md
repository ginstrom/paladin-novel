# The Reluctant Paladin

## Part III: An Unlikely Saint

### Chapter 11: The Reluctant Paladin

A month had passed since the golden light, and Gond still couldn't walk through the settlement without feeling the weight of watching eyes.

The valley had changed in those weeks. What had begun as a desperate refuge for escaped slaves had grown into something resembling a proper community. New shelters dotted the hillsides, built with salvaged timber and stone. Gardens sprouted in cleared patches, tended by those with farming knowledge. A smithy had been erected near the stream, where a former metalworker named Jorik hammered out tools and weapons from scavenged iron.

But the most significant change was in how people looked at Gond.

They no longer simply waited for his orders—they sought his blessing. Mothers brought sick children to him. Hunters asked him to consecrate their weapons. Even mundane disputes were brought before him, as if his touch with the divine granted him wisdom in all matters.

Gond hated it.

"You can't keep avoiding them," Pell said, settling beside him on the rocky outcrop where Gond had taken to eating his morning meal. Below them, the settlement bustled with activity, but Gond could see several people glancing up toward his retreat.

"I'm not avoiding them. I'm eating breakfast."

"Up here. Alone. For the third day running." Pell bit into a piece of dried meat. "They think you're angry with them."

"I'm not angry." Gond stabbed at his porridge with unnecessary force. "I'm just... tired of being treated like some kind of saint."

"You did bring a boy back from the dead."

"I healed him. There's a difference."

Pell raised an eyebrow. "Is there? Because from where I was standing, Dax was gone. No breath, no heartbeat, blood everywhere. Then you touched him and he sat up like he'd been taking a nap."

Gond set down his bowl, appetite gone. The memory of that moment still haunted him—the absolute certainty that the boy was beyond help, followed by the impossible surge of power that had proven him wrong. He'd performed smaller healings since then, mending cuts and curing fevers, but nothing approaching that first miracle.

"The power isn't always there," he said quietly. "Sometimes I reach for it and find nothing. What happens when someone really needs help and I can't—"

"Then you do what you can with your hands and your sword, same as always." Pell's voice was matter-of-fact. "But that doesn't mean you should hide from the gift when it is there."

Before Gond could respond, Sim appeared at the top of the path, slightly out of breath from the climb. "Gond, you need to come down. There's someone here to see you."

"Another sick child?"

"No." Sim's expression was strange—part wonder, part uncertainty. "An elf. She says she's been traveling for weeks, drawn here by... by Alanyi's call."

Gond and Pell exchanged glances. Elves were legends in these parts, creatures of story and song who kept to their hidden forests. What would bring one here?

They made their way down the winding path to the settlement's heart, where a crowd had gathered in a respectful circle around the newcomer. Gond could see her through the gaps between bodies—tall and graceful, with silver hair that caught the morning light and clothes that seemed to shimmer with their own inner radiance.

The crowd parted as Gond approached, and he got his first clear look at her. She was beautiful in the way of growing things—ageless and serene, with eyes the color of deep forest pools. But there was something else in those eyes, a weight of years and knowledge that made Gond feel suddenly young and foolish.

She studied him with the same intensity, her gaze lingering on his branded forehead before moving to his hands, his stance, his expression. When she spoke, her voice carried the music of wind through leaves.

"You are the one they call the Healer of the Hills."

It wasn't a question. Gond nodded anyway, acutely aware of the watching crowd. "I'm Gond. And you are?"

"Silviana Starweaver, Lore-keeper of the Moonwood Circle." She inclined her head slightly. "I have traveled far to find you, drawn by a calling I have not felt in many decades."

"What kind of calling?"

Silviana stepped closer, and Gond caught the scent of pine and starlight that seemed to cling to her. "The touch of Alanyi. Her power flows through this place like a river, and you..." She reached out as if to touch his face, then stopped, her hand hovering inches from his skin. "You are the source. I sense great gifts growing in you—some already awakened, others still sleeping, waiting for their time."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Gond felt heat rise in his cheeks, uncomfortable with the scrutiny. "I don't know about gifts. I just do what I can to help."

"Modesty." Silviana's lips curved in a slight smile. "That is good. The goddess has little use for the proud." She lowered her hand. "But false modesty serves no one. You have been chosen, Gond of the Branded Brow. The question is whether you will accept what you have become."

"And what's that?"

"A paladin of Alanyi. Her champion in a world that has forgotten her light."

The words hit the crowd like a physical blow. Some gasped, others fell to their knees. Gond heard someone whisper a prayer, another person sob with what sounded like relief.

"Forgotten her light?" Gond asked. "What do you mean?"

Silviana's expression grew grave. "The goddess of mercy has been pushed aside by those who profit from suffering. Where once her temples offered sanctuary, now the priests of Kemiss—god of commerce—hold sway, blessing chains and counting coin from slave auctions. And darker still..." She paused, glancing around at the listening crowd. "There are whispers of banned worship returning, evil cloaked in false righteousness."

"I'm not a paladin," Gond said, his voice rougher than he intended. "I'm a mercenary who got lucky."

Silviana's expression grew gentle but firm. "Luck does not raise the dead, Gond. Luck does not call an elf from her forest home after a century of silence. Luck does not gather the lost and broken and forge them into something stronger." She gestured toward the settlement around them. "Look at what you have built here. Look at what you have become."

Gond followed her gaze, seeing the community through her eyes. The former slaves who now stood tall and proud. The children who played without fear. The gardens and workshops and homes that had grown from nothing but hope and determination.

"They did this," he said. "Not me."

"They followed where you led. They trusted where you guided. They believed because you gave them reason to believe." Silviana's voice carried absolute certainty. "That is what paladins do, Gond. They kindle hope in the hopeless. They stand as light against the darkness."

Sim stepped forward, his face bright with vindication. "I told you," he said quietly. "From the beginning, I told you what you were becoming."

Gond looked at his friend, then at the elf, then at the faces surrounding them. All waiting for his response. All hoping he would accept what they already believed.

The weight of their expectation pressed down on him like a physical thing. Part of him wanted to deny it, to insist he was just a man with a useful talent. But another part—a part that had been growing stronger since that first night in the ruined temple—recognized the truth in Silviana's words.

"All right," he said finally. "Say I accept it. Say I am what you think I am. What then?"

"Then you learn," Silviana said. "You grow into your power, and your power grows with you. You discover what it truly means to serve the goddess of mercy and justice."

"And after that?"

The elf's expression grew somber. "After that, you face the trials that await all who carry Alanyi's light. The darkness has grown strong in her absence, Gond. It will not suffer a new paladin to rise unopposed."

Gond nodded slowly, feeling something settle into place inside his chest—not resignation, but acceptance. The reluctant mercenary was gone, burned away in golden fire and weeks of gradual understanding. In his place stood something new, something he was still learning to be.

"Then teach me," he said. "Both of you. Help me understand what I've become."

Silviana smiled, and for the first time it reached her ancient eyes. "The first lesson begins now. Come—there is much to discuss, and the day grows short."

As they walked toward Gond's shelter, Silviana's gaze fell upon the sword at Gond's side. Her steps slowed, and she tilted her head as if listening to something only she could hear.

"Your blade," she said quietly. "May I see it?"

Gond hesitated, then drew the silver sword. Even in the afternoon light, it seemed to gleam with its own inner radiance, the steel unmarked despite weeks of use.

Silviana's eyes widened with recognition. "By the ancient trees," she whispered. "I had heard rumors, but to see it with my own eyes..." She looked up at Gond with something approaching reverence. "Do you know what you carry?"

"A sword that used to be crude iron," Gond said. "It changed during the battle when I first healed Dax."

"Not just any sword. A blade touched by divine will." Silviana's voice carried the weight of ancient knowledge. "The old songs speak of such weapons—steel transformed by righteous purpose, forged not in earthly fires but in the crucible of a paladin's awakening. There have been perhaps a dozen such blades in all the long years since Alanyi first walked among mortals."

Sim moved closer, his eyes bright with wonder. "The legends are true, then? About paladin weapons?"

"More than true. They are living things, in their way—extensions of the divine will that flows through their bearers." Silviana gestured toward the blade. "That steel will never dull, never break, never fail you in righteous battle. It will grow in power as you grow, becoming more than mere metal as your connection to Alanyi deepens."

Gond stared at the sword, remembering the moment it had sheared through the slaver captain's weapon like parchment. "It cut through steel during the battle."

"And it will do far more than that, in time." Silviana's expression grew distant, remembering. "The last such blade I saw was carried by Ser Aldric the Pure, three centuries past. His sword could cleave through enchanted armor as if it were silk, and its light could banish shadows that had never known the sun."

"What happened to him?" Gond asked.

"He fell defending a village from a demon incursion, his blade blazing like a star until the very end." Silviana's voice was soft with old grief. "But the sword endured. It always does, waiting for the next worthy hand to claim it."

Gond sheathed the weapon carefully, feeling its weight differently now. Not just steel and leather, but legacy and responsibility.

As they walked toward Gond's shelter, the crowd began to disperse, but Gond could feel their eyes following him. The weight of their hope, their faith, their need. It no longer felt quite so crushing. Instead, it felt like purpose.

The transformation was complete. The real work was just beginning.

Behind them, Sim fell into step with a spring in his stride that hadn't been there in weeks. "A paladin," he murmured, just loud enough for Gond to hear. "Alanyi be praised, I knew it from the start."

"Don't get smug about it," Gond said, but there was no real irritation in his voice.

"Wouldn't dream of it," Sim replied, grinning.

Silviana glanced between them, her expression amused. "I see you have already learned one of the most important lessons of being a paladin."

"Which is?"

"That even the chosen need friends to keep them humble."

Despite everything—the weight of destiny, the burden of power, the uncertainty of what lay ahead—Gond found himself smiling.

Perhaps being a paladin wouldn't be so terrible after all.
