## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 7: The Gradual Awakening

Three weeks after finding the valley, when Pell started down what appeared to be a clear trail, Gond's hand shot out, stopping him. Bird calls had shifted to warning silence, and something prickled along his spine.

"Wait."

Pell frowned, scanning the area. "Looks clear to me."

He studied the path more carefully, noting how the grass lay too flat, how no birds sang in the nearby trees. "There." He pointed to a barely visible depression in the earth. "Pit trap. And fresh horse dung beyond those rocks."

Within minutes, dust clouds appeared on the horizon. Slave catchers, moving fast along the very route Pell had suggested.

"How did you—" Lira began.

"Lucky guess." Gond was already moving, leading them through dense thickets that tore at their clothes but kept them hidden. "Years of staying alive in hostile territory."

Sim's gaze lingered on him, thoughtful and knowing, but the priest said nothing.

They found an alternate route through brambles and broken stone. As evening approached, tensions within their group began to fray. Aerin and Korven—a surly man who'd joined them two days prior—squared off over their dwindling food supplies.

"Children eat first," Aerin insisted, her voice rising with each word. "That's how decent people behave."

"Decent people don't survive long." Korven's hand drifted toward his knife. "Strong eat, weak starve. That's nature."

Other refugees began choosing sides, voices rising, hands moving toward weapons. The fragile unity of their group cracked like thin ice.

Gond stepped between them. When he spoke, his voice carried a weight that seemed to settle over the entire group like a heavy blanket.

"Enough."

The single word hung in the air. Korven's hand froze halfway to his blade. Aerin's mouth closed with an audible snap. Even the children stopped their restless fidgeting.

"We share what we have, or we all starve together." Gond's eyes moved from face to face, holding each gaze until they looked away. "Korven, you take first watch. Aerin, help Sim with the injured. Everyone else, make camp."

The argument died as if it had never been. Korven nodded curtly and moved to his assigned position. Aerin gathered the children without complaint. The others dispersed to their tasks, the tension evaporating like morning mist.

Pell appeared at Gond's elbow as they settled for the night. "That was... interesting. Since when do you command that kind of authority?"

"Since I started making sense instead of noise." But even as Gond spoke, he wondered at how easily the conflict had resolved. The words had felt right in his mouth, weighted with certainty he didn't understand.

Later that evening, one of the newer refugees—a man named Jorik—took a turn for the worse. Fever burned through him, and angry red lines spread from a festering wound on his arm. Sim worked tirelessly, applying herbs and murmuring prayers, but the infection was winning.

"Let me help." Gond knelt beside the dying man without conscious thought.

"I don't think—" Sim began, then stopped as Gond placed his hands on Jorik's burning forehead.

The warmth from the temple stirred in Gond's chest, flowing down his arms and into his palms. Jorik's fever broke within moments, the red lines fading like chalk washed from stone. Within an hour, the man was sitting up and asking for food.

"Remarkable recovery." Sim's voice was carefully neutral. "The herbs work swiftly when properly applied."

Gond nodded, accepting the explanation like a lifeline. "Your goddess has good timing."

But privately, he flexed his fingers, half-expecting to see some visible sign of change. They looked the same as always—scarred, callused, ordinary. Yet the warmth lingered, and with it, questions he wasn't ready to ask.

That night, during his watch, Gond found himself studying the sleeping faces around their fire. When had he become the one they looked to for answers? When had their survival become his responsibility?

Soft footsteps announced Sim's approach. The priest settled beside him on the rocky ledge, gazing out at the star-filled sky.

"Troubled thoughts?"

"Just wondering how we got here." Gond kept his voice low. "Few weeks ago, I was a sellsword with no responsibilities beyond my next meal. Now..."

"Now you carry the hopes of two dozen souls." Sim's voice held no judgment. "Heavy burden."

"One I never asked for."

"The best leaders rarely do." The priest was quiet for a moment. "Alanyi often chooses those who are reluctant to serve. Perhaps because they understand the weight."

Gond glanced at him. "You really believe your goddess is involved in this?"

"The smallest seed can grow into the mightiest oak, given proper soil." Sim's smile was gentle in the starlight. "Sometimes strength comes from unexpected places."

A low growl echoed from the darkness beyond their camp. Gond tensed, hand moving to his sword, but instead of fear, a strange calm settled over him. He stood slowly, walking to the edge of their firelight.

A large wolf emerged from the shadows, eyes reflecting the dying flames. The refugees who were awake froze in terror, but Gond felt no threat from the creature. Instead, he sensed curiosity, even recognition.

"Easy," he murmured—whether to the wolf or his companions, he wasn't sure. "No harm here."

The wolf studied him for a long moment, head tilted as if listening to something only it could hear. Then it turned and melted back into the darkness, leaving only the memory of amber eyes and the scent of wild places.

"How did you know it wouldn't attack?" Aerin whispered.

Gond returned to his post, settling beside Sim once more. "Sometimes you just know."

Aerin's gaze shifted to Sim. "How do you always know which herbs to use? Jorik should have died from that infection."

Sim's fingers traced patterns in the dirt. "The forest teaches those who listen. Every plant has its purpose."

The priest's knowing look followed him, but Sim said nothing more. They sat in comfortable silence, watching the stars wheel overhead, while around them the refugees slept peacefully under Gond's protection.

The warmth in his chest pulsed gently, like a second heartbeat, and Gond found himself wondering what other changes were stirring within him—changes he could feel but not yet name.
