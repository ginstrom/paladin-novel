# Paladin's Rise

## Part II: Seeds of Rebellion

### Chapter 7: The Gradual Awakening

The terrain grew harsher as they climbed deeper into the hills. Jagged rocks thrust from the earth like broken teeth, and thorny brambles caught at clothes and skin. Gond led with tireless purpose, his sword clearing a path through the worst tangles. Each choice of route proved sound—every decision led them closer to something he could feel but not yet see.

It took the party another week to find the valley. Trudging over steep hills, the land opened suddenly into a wide valley sheltered by towering cliffs. A narrow waterfall tumbled down one sheer wall, pooling into a lake so clear Gond could see the bottom twenty feet down. Green grass carpeted the valley floor, dotted with wildflowers and fruit trees gone wild. The band quickly set up camp and started setting up a more permanent encampment.

A week later, the first of the refugees arrived.

They came in ones, twos, and threes, with similar stories for the most part: escaped slaves, peasants fleeing cruel masters, apprentices put out by their masters. Another commonality to all the refugees was a name mentioned: Maera. She had started sending refugees on to them. Where she sent them before nobody knew.

Sim took charge of the refugees, arranging shelter, and giving them tasks to keep the group fed and prepare for winter.

Three weeks after finding the valley, Gond, Lira and Pell were out hunting. When Pell started down what appeared to be a clear trail, Gond's hand shot out, stopping him. Bird calls had shifted to warning silence, and something prickled along his spine. He felt his attention drawn down the trail.

"Wait."

Pell frowned, scanning the area. "Looks clear to me."

He studied the path more carefully, noting how the grass lay too flat, how no birds sang in the nearby trees. "There." He pointed to a barely visible depression in the earth. "There was a camp here. They buried the fire pit there. And there's fresh horse dung beyond those rocks."

Within minutes, dust clouds appeared on the horizon. An armed party, moving fast along the very route Pell had suggested.

"How did you—" Lira began.

"Lucky guess." Gond was already moving, leading them through dense thickets that tore at their clothes but kept them hidden. "Years of staying alive in hostile territory."

They found an alternate route through brambles and broken stone. Back at the encampment, as evening approached, tensions within their group began to fray. Lira and Korven—a surly man who'd joined them two days prior—squared off over their dwindling food supplies.

"Children eat first," Lira insisted, her voice rising with each word. "That's how decent people behave."

"Decent people don't survive long." Korven's hand drifted toward his knife. "Strong eat, weak starve. That's nature."

Other refugees began choosing sides, voices rising, hands moving toward weapons. The fragile unity of their group cracked like thin ice.

Gond stepped between them. When he spoke, his voice seemed to settle over the entire group like a soothing balm.

"Enough."

The single word hung in the air. Korven's hand froze halfway to his blade. Aerin's mouth closed with an audible snap. Even the children stopped their restless fidgeting.

"We share what we have, or we all starve together." Gond's eyes moved from face to face, holding each gaze until they looked away. "Korven, you take first watch. Everyone else, you know your jobs."

The argument died as if it had never been. Korven nodded curtly and moved to his assigned position. Lira gathered the children and began tending them. The others dispersed to their tasks, the tension evaporating like morning mist.

Pell appeared at Gond's elbow as they settled for the night. "That was... interesting. Since when do you command that kind of authority?"

"Since I started making sense instead of noise." But even as Gond spoke, he wondered at how easily the conflict had resolved. The words had felt right in his mouth, weighted with certainty he didn't understand.

Later that evening, one of the newer refugees—a man named Jorik—took a turn for the worse. Fever burned through him, and angry red lines spread from a festering wound on his arm. Sim worked tirelessly, applying herbs and murmuring prayers, but the infection was winning.

Gond knelt beside the dying man without conscious thought. His memory of the temple stirred, and he felt that me must touch Jorik.

"I don't think—" Sim began, then stopped as Gond placed his hands on Jorik's burning forehead.

Gond felt nothing, but saw Jorik's fever break within moments. The red lines faded like chalk washed from stone. Within an hour, the man was sitting up and asking for food.

"Remarkable recovery." Sim's voice was carefully neutral. "The herbs work swiftly when properly applied."

Gond nodded, accepting the explanation like a lifeline. "Your goddess has good timing."

But privately, he flexed his fingers, half-expecting to see some visible sign of change. They looked the same as always—scarred, callused, ordinary. Yet the memory of that voice in the temple lingered, and with it, questions he wasn't ready to ask.

That night, during his watch, Gond found himself studying the sleeping faces around their fire. When had he become the one they looked to for answers? When had their survival become his responsibility?

Soft footsteps announced Sim's approach. The priest settled beside him on the rocky ledge, gazing out at the star-filled sky.

"Troubled thoughts?"

"Just wondering how we got here." Gond kept his voice low. "Few weeks ago, I was a sellsword with no responsibilities beyond my next meal. Now..."

"Now you carry the hopes of two dozen souls." Sim's voice held no judgment. "Heavy burden."

"One I never asked for."

"The best leaders rarely do." The priest was quiet for a moment. "Alanyi often chooses those who are reluctant to serve. Perhaps because they understand the weight."

Gond glanced at him. "You really believe your goddess is involved in this?"

"The smallest seed can grow into the mightiest oak, given proper soil." Sim's smile was gentle in the starlight. "Sometimes strength comes from unexpected places."

Aerin's gaze shifted to Sim. "How do you always know which herbs to use? Jorik should have died from that infection."

Sim's fingers traced patterns in the dirt. "The forest teaches those who listen. Every plant has its purpose."

The priest's knowing look followed him, but Sim said nothing more. They sat in comfortable silence, watching the stars wheel overhead, while around them the refugees slept peacefully under Gond's protection.

A warmth in his chest pulsed gently, and Gond found himself wondering what other changes were stirring within him—changes he could feel but not yet name.
