### Chapter 1: The Mark of Betrayal

Gond awoke slowly, consciousness arriving like an unwelcome guest—each new sensation a fresh insult. First, taste: blood mixed unpleasantly with stale ale and something bitter, almost medicinal. Then came smell, a gut-churning blend of salty ocean brine, unwashed bodies, and moldy wood. Next, the pain: a relentless ache pulsed behind his eyes, punctuated by sharper agony across his forehead. Wonderful.

He opened an eye, immediately regretting it as a dim, swaying gloom greeted him. Moonlight seeped through the cracked wooden ceiling, hinting at movement—a gentle, nauseating roll beneath him.

A ship, then. Just my luck. Gond shifted slightly, rewarded by the clink of iron and a tug at his wrist. Manacled, of course.

"Must’ve been one hell of a night," he muttered, his voice cracking like brittle parchment. "Or a terrible one."

He attempted to sit up, head spinning in protest, and immediately toppled back with a groan. Steeling himself, Gond slowly rose again, leaning back heavily against damp, splintering timber. His eyes adjusted, making out other shapes, dimly lit by the faint moonbeams filtering through the cracks. A dozen miserable wretches huddled around him, chained together in pairs, shivering or simply too numb to care.

Lovely company I keep these days.

A rank odor, ripe with stale sweat and despair, emanated from the man chained beside him. Gond registered it with the weary disinterest of one long accustomed to the stench of close-packed, miserable humanity. The man was built like a dockside brawler, all thick muscle and sullen resentment, though bruises marred his face and his breathing was labored. His eyes, when they flickered open, held a dull, dangerous spark. *This one might fight*, Gond thought, his gaze lingering for a moment, *or get us all killed trying.*

He shifted his gaze to the pair chained before him. One lay unnaturally still, head lolling at an angle that spoke of a broken neck or a final, exhausted surrender. Flies already buzzed around the open, vacant eyes. Beside him, the other slave, a gaunt figure, coughed weakly, a rattling sound deep in his chest. Each breath seemed a monumental effort, his skin a waxy, translucent sheen. *Not long for this world, either of them,* Gond assessed, a familiar grimness settling in. Gond thought briefly of the many bodies he had seen during his 10-odd years as a mercenary. Nearly all of them had died in battle, he recalled. Seeing men dead or dying in such a way was somehow much sadder. Gond turned away and continued surveying his surroundings.

Ahead, two bodies slumped in defeat, unmoving and likely closer to death than life. Behind him came the rasping breath of someone whose fury simmered audibly, like an angry kettle ready to boil over.

Lovely crew. We’ll be a riot at parties.

Gond flexed his hands, testing the chains, finding them solid and depressingly secure. His captors weren’t amateurs, then. Sighing inwardly, he turned his thoughts to memories—fragments of laughter and tankards clinking in the dim warmth of the Prancing Dragon Inn. Borin's drunken voice rang in his ears: "To Gond, luckiest sword on the coast!" followed quickly by Kael’s smirk, cold eyes glittering in shadow, whispering, "Business, mate. Nothing personal."

"Loyal friends indeed," Gond muttered bitterly.

A sudden itch flared on his forehead, and his fingers rose instinctively, brushing tender, inflamed flesh. His blood ran cold as he recognized the shape, freshly branded—a slave’s mark, two intertwined manacles burned cruelly into his skin.

"Bastards," Gond spat, anger rising sharp and fierce.

His gaze fell on a bucket of brackish water set nearby, its surface barely reflecting the dim light. Grimacing, Gond leaned forward, peering into the murky reflection. A ghostly image stared back, a face battered and bruised, marked forever by the brand. He felt a surge of nausea, not from seasickness but rage—a rage that sharpened his senses and clarified his thoughts.

The rhythmic creaking of the hull, the muttered curses and sobs around him, and the careless banter of guards drifting down from above—they painted a grim picture. Not just any ship. A slave ship.

Footsteps echoed above, laughter coarse and indifferent. Occasionally, food was tossed down carelessly—a scrap of moldy bread, stale water in filthy pails. Those too weak or slow were left where they lay, living or dead indistinguishable in the shadows. Whips cracked casually, warnings to the noisy or unruly.

Gond smiled humorlessly. Well, at least the service matches the accommodations.

His attention shifted to the hatch above, outlined dimly against the faint lamplight. Guards lounged there, bored and complacent—too complacent. Gond’s cold fury hardened into resolve. Patience, cunning, and opportunity would see him free. Survive first. Then repay every betrayal in kind.

"Rest up, friends," he whispered grimly into the darkness. "The entertainment's just about to begin."
