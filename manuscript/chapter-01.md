### Chapter 1: The Mark of Betrayal

Gond's tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth like old leather. The taste coating his teeth—blood, stale ale, and something bitter that made his throat constrict—told him this wasn't a typical morning after. His forehead throbbed with each heartbeat, the pain sharp enough to make his eyes water before he'd even opened them.

When he finally cracked one eyelid, pale moonlight leaked through gaps in warped planking above. The surface beneath him rose and fell in a gentle rhythm that sent his stomach lurching sideways. 

*Ship.* The realization hit him like cold water. *Wonderful.*

Iron clinked against his wrist as he tried to sit up. Manacles. Of course. His second attempt to rise succeeded, though he had to lean heavily against splintered timber that felt damp under his palm.

The hold stretched before him in the dim light—a collection of hunched shapes chained in pairs. The air hung thick with the smell of unwashed bodies, fear-sweat, and something else. Something that made him breathe through his mouth.

The man beside him had shoulders like a dock worker and fists to match, though purple bruises mottled his face. His breathing came in harsh rasps, and when his eyes flicked open, they held the kind of spark that meant trouble. The muscles in his jaw kept working, like he was chewing on words too dangerous to speak.

Across from Gond, two figures slumped forward. One sat perfectly still—too still. His head lolled at an angle that spoke of either a broken neck or final surrender, and flies had begun their grisly work around his vacant stare. His companion coughed wetly, each breath a visible struggle. Waxy skin stretched over sharp cheekbones, and his chest barely moved with each shallow intake.

*Not much time left for that one.*

Two more bodies lay motionless further into the hold. Behind him, someone breathed like an angry bull, all snorts and barely contained fury.

Gond flexed his fingers, testing the chain's give. Solid. Professional work. His captors knew their business.

Memory crept back in fragments—Borin's flushed face raised in a toast at the Prancing Dragon, his voice booming over the tavern's din: "To Gond, luckiest sword on the coast!" Kael's answering smirk, those cold eyes catching torchlight as he leaned close. "Business, mate. Nothing personal."

The alley behind the inn. The prick of something sharp in his neck. Darkness.

An itch flared across his forehead, and his fingers rose instinctively. They found raised, tender flesh—still raw, still seeping. The shape was unmistakable even by touch alone. Two interlocking rings. A slave's brand.

His hand fell away, fingers curling into a fist.

A bucket of murky water sat within reach, its surface barely catching the moonlight. Gond leaned forward until he could make out his reflection—a ghost-pale face staring back, marked forever by the crude iron circles burned into his skin.

The ship creaked around him in steady rhythm. Above, boots scuffed across deck planks, punctuated by coarse laughter and the occasional crack of a whip. When food came—moldy bread and brackish water in filthy buckets—guards tossed it down like they were feeding animals. Those too weak to crawl for their share simply went without.

One guard leaned over the hatch opening, grinning down at them. "Comfortable down there, are we? Don't worry—journey's nearly over. Then the real fun begins."

More laughter echoed from above.

Gond's gaze drifted to the hatch, studying the lazy way the guards moved, how they clustered together instead of watching properly. Sloppy. Overconfident.

He settled back against the hull, closing his eyes. Let them think him broken. Let them grow careless.

His lips curved in the barest suggestion of a smile.

*Entertainment's just about to begin.*
