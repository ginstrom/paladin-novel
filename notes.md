## Overall Patterns Across Chapters 11-26:

### Consistent Issues to Address:

1. **Divine Power Descriptions**: Too many variations of "stirred within him" - need unique physical sensations
2. **Emotional Telling**: Direct labeling of feelings rather than showing through action
3. **Battle Descriptions**: Sometimes summarize rather than show specific combat moments
4. **Crowd Reactions**: Often tell about "murmurs" rather than show specific individual responses

### Continuity Strengths:

1. **Character Arcs**: All major transformations properly tracked
2. **Divine Development**: Gond's growing powers consistently shown
3. **Political Evolution**: The escalation from settlement to continental movement logical
4. **Thematic Consistency**: Mercy over vengeance theme maintained throughout

### Recurring Improvements Needed:

1. **Divine Manifestations**: Each should have unique physical characteristics
2. **Cultural Details**: Add more specific dwarven/elven cultural elements
3. **Sacred Spaces**: Temples and shrines need more atmospheric detail
4. **Time Transitions**: Show passage of time through environmental changes

### Strong Elements to Preserve:

1. **Battle Tactics**: The strategic elements are well-thought-out
2. **Political Complexity**: The various factions and their motivations are clear
3. **Character Voice**: Gond's sardonic humor comes through consistently
4. **Thematic Depth**: The spiritual evolution never overwhelms the human story
